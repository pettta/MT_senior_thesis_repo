Jakugen developed a school later , so there were two schools of Shomyo in Ohara .

Subsequently , Shukai restored Ohara Shomyo .

Tanchi established a stream based on a new form of music theory .

Since then , it became the center of Tendai Shomyo , and it has been inherited by the present Tendai Shomyo .

The Yuzunembutsu-shu sect , Jodo-shu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect represent the lineage of Tendai Shomyo .

Shingon Shomyo has been passed down to the present day based on what Kukai introduced .

Shomyo was systematized after Shinga .

Particularly , Kancho was known as the patriarch of the Restoration .

He worked on the composition and control of Shomyo .

There were numerous schools until the Kamakura period , but the princely priest Kakusho reorganized them into four : the Honsoinryu School , Shinsoinryu School , Daigoryu School and Nakagawa-Daishinryu School .

Shomyo , of the Kogi ( old ) Shingonshu sect , declined and became extinct with the emergence of the Edo period .

The Honsoinryu School , Shinsoinryu School and Daigoryu School were extinguished by the middle of the Meiji period .

Currently , it is divided into Chizan Shomyo ( Chishakuin , Kyoto ) , Buzan Shomyo ( Hase-dera Temple , Nara ) , Nanzan-shinryu School ( Mt . Koya-san and Kogi Shingonshu sect temples , Kyoto ) .

Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo ( Shingi ( new ) Shingonshu sect Shomyo ) : Shomyo of Chizan-ha Buddhists , Shingon-shu sect and that of Buzan-ha Buddhists , Shingon-shu sect were originally derived from the Nakagawa-Daishinryu School .

Raiyu took in the traditional school of Daigo .

In 1585 , when Negoro-ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and went into decline , the Chizan and Buzan schools formed a school based on the traditional school of Daigo .

It features Buzan 's ' Logic ' and Chizan 's ' Shomyo . '

Nanzan-shinryu School ( Kogi Shingonshu sect Shomyo ) : This school is based on the Nakagawa-Daishinryu School .

The Nakagawa-Daishinryu School has Daishin , of Naka-no-gawadera Temple , Nara , as the founder of the school .

During the years 1232 and 1233 , Shoshin , of Sanboin Temple in Renge-dani ( Mt . Koya-san ) , moved his stronghold to Mt . Koya-san .

Later , it was called the Nanzan-shinryu School , being named after Nanzan , another name for Mt . Koya-san .

It is also called the Shinryu School or the Yasan Shinryu School .

The music of Heikyoku , Yokyoku , Minyo or Joruri can be said to be variations of Shomyo .

Its has had a great impact on monophony ( unaccompanied music ) .

Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji )

Male

Empress Suiko ( 626 ) - Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) ( January 10 , 672 )

The 38th Emperor

Kokufu Shigo is Amemikoto hirakasuwake no mikoto / Amatsumikoto sakiwake no mikoto

The first name is Kazuraki ( Katsuragi ) .

It is presumed that he was once called Kazuraki no miko ( Katsuragi no miko ) .

He is generally known as Nakano Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) .

The " oe " means " prince , " and " Nakano oe " means " second prince . "

Overview

He was the second prince of Emperor Jome .

The mother was Takara no Himemiko ( later called Empress Kogyoku ) .

The Empress was Yamatohime no Okimi , daughter of Emperor 's half-brother , Furuhito no Oe no Miko .

The Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) plotted a rebellion with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and seized power in a coup to kill SOGA no Iruka , by which his uncle Emperor Kotoku came to power and he became a prince .

He established a new era--the Taika--and made many reforms during this period ( he was a key person in the Taika reforms and Itsushi no hen ) .

He devised a plan to trap an opposition group that included Arima no Miko , who might have caused a coup in the future , and they were executed .

As Baekje was destroyed by the Silla ( Kingdom ) and Tang in 660 , the Baekje prince , Buyeo Pung , who was staying at the Imperial Court , was sent back to his country to save Baekje .

The Emperor stayed at Tsukushi to send covert troops to Baekje , but Empress Saimei died in 661 .

Eventually , the Emperor took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony , but then he was severely defeated in the Battle of Hakusukinoe and moved to Otsu City to be enthroned in 663 .

After the Battle of Hakusukinoe a castle surrounded by water was built , and Noroshi and Sakimori ( the conscript soldier system in the old days ) were organized to protect the territory .

Moreover , the system of ranking officials was changed from 19 levels to 26 levels .

In 670 the first national family registry , " Kogo-nenjaku , " was introduced .

According to " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) , " the Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) wanted the first prince , Otomo no Miko , to be his successor .

However , after the death of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) his brother , Oama no Miko ( Emperor Temmu ) , defeated Otomo no Miko in the Jinshin War ( the Jinshin Disturbance ) and was enthroned .

Subsequently , Emperor Temmu 's ancestry remained in power until Empress Shotoku .

After the death of Empress Shotoku , Sirakabe no Okimi , a grandchild of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was enthroned as Emperor Konin and subsequently Emperor Tenchi 's ( Tenji 's ) ancestry stayed in power .

It is said that because Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) took Nukata no Okimi away from Oama no Miko ( Emperor Temmu ) , he sent his four daughters to Oama no Miko ( Emperor Temmu ) to become princesses for an expiation .

Brief Personal History

Born in 626

Rittaishi ( the ceremony to institute the Crown Prince ) was held on July 15 , 645 .

Politics began without having an enthronement ceremony August 27 , 661 .

The enthronement was held on February 23 , 668 .

He died on January 10 , 672 at age 46 .

( According to " Fuso-Ryakki " , he died from an illness , but another explanation that has been offered is that he went missing in the mountains and that Emperor Temmu had him assassinated . )

It was one of the mysteries of the mid-seventh century that Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) did not stay in power for a long time .

Various theories have been suggested in regard to the matter .

This was the consideration for setting up Emperor Temmu 's backbone .

There was an accepted theory that Emperor Temmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) , but this is denied ; another theory is that Emperor Temmu was Aya no Miko , whom Empress Kogyoku had before she married Emperor Jomei , and that he was an older half-brother of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) .

It is apparent that Emperor Temmu was older than Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) after tracing back their ages according to the Emperor Tenchi 's ( Tenji 's ) age at death in " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) " and the Emperor Temmu 's age at death in other history books .

The information is consistent in the same historical records , and there are eight to nine years of age difference between the two emperors .

Some people say that Emperor Temmu 's age was purposely falsified since it was an embarrassing fact that the younger brother became the emperor before his older brother even though they are half-brothers with the same mother ; but some argue that according to " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) , " Emperor Temmu 's age was 16 when his father , Emperor Jomei , was enthroned , but it was said that he was 16 when his father died .

Therefore , the Emperor 's real year of birth is 614 , according to the Royal Family Tree ( Honcho-koin-jounroku ) .

It was usual to have no successor to the Imperial Throne for some period ( in fact , Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) and Empress Jito , who were in power before and after Emperor Temmu , took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony ) .

Some argue that this caused the errors in their ages .

Some people have said that because " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) " and other indicated history books are edited in different years and they are different in character , they cannot be treated alike . "

Please refer to the section " The Age of Emperor Temmu . "

There is a theory that the Isshi no Hen was a coup caused by Karu no Miko ( Emperor Kotoku ) , in which Naka no Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) lost his position .

It has recently been indicated that Naka no Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) and Sogano Iruka had a relatively good relationship and similar basic policies .

This way there is no reason that Naka no Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) would have assassinated Iruka .

Because there is falsification in the definition of Taika 's reform in " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) , " this theory has become apparent .

This theory gets a lot of attention because it can explain Empress Kogyoku 's abdication or the reason that the Soga Family ( except Iruka ) was not displaced from politics after the coup .

There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was delayed due to the complaints against his relationship with women .

This is based on the theory that Emperor Kotoku sent a poem to his wife Hashihito no Himemiko ( Emperor Tenchi 's ( Tenji ) sister with the same mother ) indicating that Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was having an affair with her , which is contained in " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) . "

In those days , romance and marriage were allowed between half-sisters and brothers from different mothers but not between half-brothers and sisters from the same mother ; however , in the comic story " Tenjo no niji ( The Rainbow in the Sky ) , " by Machiko SATONAKA , it is described that there was a romance involving this kind of forbidden love ; Hashihito no Himemiko was persuaded to marry with Karu no Miko ( Emperor Kotoku ) , but she kept the relationship with Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) , and Arima no Miko was furious after knowing this and became angry at Hashihito no Himemiko .

There is a theory that Hashihito no Himemiko ascended the throne as the princess of the previous Emperor but one and became an Empress after the death of Empress Saimei ; however , for some reason her name was erased from the record .

In the Man 'yoshu ( " The Anthology of Myriad Leaves ) , " " Nakatsusumera-mikoto " is considered to be Hashihito no Himemiko , and it is said that the one named " Nakatsusumera-mikoto " was a temporary Emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) .

If Hashihito no Himemiko was the same person as " Nakatsusumera-mikoto , " there is a question why only she had this special name ; alternatively , it is said that this name could have been for Empress Saimei , but there is no proof .

It is hard to prove , since this is about political history with limited data ; however , it is expected to have clearer information from close study in relation to the findings of archaeology .

Poems

The Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was a poet who had four poems in " Man 'yoshu ( The Anthology of Myriad Leaves ) . "

He was respected as the Emperor of the Heian dynasty , and one of his poems is found at the beginning of " One Hundred Waka Poems ( the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets ) . "

I am sitting in the barn next to a rice field when rice is harvested in the autumn and my kimono sleeves get wet by night dew , as the roof of the barn is covered with rough-bladed hay .

The following poem is from " Man 'yoshu ( The Anthology of Myriad Leaves ) . "

In ancient days , Mt . Kagu-yama loved Mt . Unebi-yama and fought against Mt . Miminashi-yama for love ; there is no doubt we still fight for love between wives , as it has been the same since the age of the gods .

The Saionji Family were court nobility descended from the Fujiwara clan .

The Saionji Family was of the Fujiwara clan Fujiwara-hokke Kaninryu , and the Kakaku ( family rank of court nobility ) was the Seiga Family .

The Toin Family and Imadegawa / Kikutei Family were branch families of the Saionji Family .

There was a samurai family--the Saionji clan in Iyo-no-kuni--as a major offshoot that used the Saionji surname .

The family crest is Hidari-mitsudomoe .

The progenitor of the Saionji Family was FUJIWARA no Michisue , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kimizane .

Kintsune SAIONJI , who was a great grandson of Michisue , was confined by the imperial court during the Jokyu-no-ran War because , having married the niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo , he was being watched over as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ; after the war , however , Kintsune gained the confidence of the shogunate , wielded the real power in the imperial court through holding the office of Kanto Moshitsugi , and rose to the position of Daijo daijin ( grand minister of state ) , raising the social standing of the Saionji Family .

The family name of Saionji comes from the name of the temple Kintsune built at Bettei , in Kyoto ( Kitayama-so , Kadono-gun , Yamashiro-no-kuni ) .

This hall is also called Kitayama-dono Palace , and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA after he was given this land by the Saionji Family .

Since the generation of Kintsune , the Saionji Family gained support from the Kamakura shogunate and came to power that surpassed the sekke throughout the Kamakura era .

Sanekane SAIONJI approached Daikaku-ji through genealogy and made his daughters marry Kameyama ho-ou , the ex-emperor , or the Emperor Godaigo .

However , since the generation of Sanekane 's son Kinhira SAIONJI , the Saionji Family this time supported the Jimyoin-to genealogy when the Daikakuji-to genealogy started to keep a distance from the bakufu , thereby deepening the conflict with the Daikakuji-to genealogy .

Thereafter , at the generation of Kinmune SAIONJI , the Saionji Family was dismissed from the post of Kanto Moshitsugi after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate .

Kinmune harbored Yasuie HOJO , who was a remnant of the Hojo clan , the assassinated Emperor Godaigo , who had started Kenmu-no-shinsei ; plotted a rebellion to back the ex-emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin-to genealogy ; and was arrested and executed , the plot having been exposed by the betrayal of Kinmune 's younger brother , Kinshige SAIONJI .

During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Kinmune 's son Sanetoshi SAIONJI served Hokucho ( Japan ) and rose to the post of minister of the right , whereby the family name was restored .

During the Muromachi and Edo periods the Saionji Family was also known for having biwa ( Japanese lute ) players as a family business .

In the early days of the Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime , who was the eldest daughter of Kyumu NAGAOKA ( also known as Tadataka HOSOKAWA ) , as the Midaidokoro ( wife of a shogun or a highest-ranking nobleman ) of the heir ( later disinherited ) of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA , and invited her to accept the post of Sadaijin ( minister of the left ) ; moreover , Kyumu NAGAOKA offered various forms of financial support to the Saionji family , including donating a property that yielded 600 koku of rice ( Menko-shuroku ) .

At the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Tokudaiji Family of the same kaninryu , worked as a politician after the Meiji Restoration , served as prime minister , and had great influence as a genro on the political scene during the Taisho and Showa eras .

There is an anecdote that Kinmochi was not good at playing the biwa Japanese lute , which should have been the family business of the Saionji Family , and during Kinmochi 's time in office as prime minister , the Emperor Meiji said out of mischief to Kinmochi , " For the first time in a long while , I would like to listen to biwa Japanese lute , " and therefore he was forced to play the biwa Japanese lute in dire distress together with the officials of Utaryo in the Imperial Household Ministry .

Mt . Hiei is a mountain that straddles the western part of Otsu City in Shiga Prefecture and the northeastern part of Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture .

Mt . Hiei is the name for the Soji ridge , which is formed by two peaks : Daihiei ( 848.3m ) on the border between Otsu City and Kyoto City 's Sakyo Ward ; and Shimeigatake in Sakyo Ward ( 838m ) .

Daihiei 's first-order triangulation point is located in Otsu City .

Next to Mt . Koya , it has long been an object of religious belief , flourishing with Enryaku-ji Temple and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine on it .

It is part of the Higashiyama mountains ( Kyoto Prefecture ) .

It is also known as Eizan , Hokurei , Tendaisan , Miyakofuji , etc .

Overview

Because of its location near the Kimon gate on the northeast side of Kyoto , Mt . Hiei is considered a castle guardian .

The Kojiki ( Records of Ancient Matters ) calls Mt . Hiei ' Hienoyama ' , and records that Oyamakui no kami is enshrined on Hienoyama in Omi Province , and Narikabura is the object of worship .

Ever since Enryaku-ji Temple was founded on Hienoyama , Oyamakui no kami , as the god of the land , has been a guardian deity of the Tendai Sect and Enryaku-ji Temple ; and a mountain-king sect based on him has spread in the area .

Also , it is the mountain where Enryaku-ji Temple 's Thousand-Day Circumambulation Practice is done , including a pilgrimage to the shrines at the peak of Mt . Hiei , and to Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine at its foot .

Hiking is popular , and a famous trail begins at Shugakuin in Sakyo Ward of Kyoto City and goes up Kirarazaka hill ; another one on the Shiga Prefecture side begins in Monzenmachi , Sakamoto ( Otsu City ) , and goes up through Mudojidani valley .

The path on Kirarazaka hill has long been used by monks , monk soldiers and imperial messengers traveling between Kyoto and Enryaku-ji Temple , and is still visited by many hikers today .

The Tokaido Nature Trail passes through the mountain on the way from Otsu to Kyoto / Ohara .

Many tourists come on holidays , since they can reach the top via toll road , cable car , and ropeway .

There used to be a Mt . Hiei Amusement Park and a Mt . Hiei Artificial Ski Slope , but both were closed before 2002 ; the site of the ski slope is now a cosmos flower garden , and there is an art museum - Hiei Garden Museum - on the former location of the amusement park .

There was also a Forest Land Amusement Park in Yase , at the foot of the mountain on the Kyoto side , although that was closed on November 30 , 2001 , and a members-only resort hotel now stands in that location .

Daihiei and Shimeigatake

The survey findings from the Geographical Survey Institute show the eastern peak as Daihiei , the western peak as Shimeigatake , and both of them together as Mt . Hiei .

According to " Ten no Ki " ( The Record of Survey ) , the first-order triangulation point on the eastern peak is called " Mt . Hiei " .

Although this marker is located at the border between Otsu and Kyoto cities , it is inside Otsu City .

When one views Mt . Hiei from the Kyoto basin , it is difficult to see the Daihiei peak , so some think that Shimeigatake is the peak of Mt . Hiei .

The Keifuku Electric Railroad Eizan Ropeway has its Hiei Mountaintop Station placed on the Shimeigatake peak .

There are conflicting opinions as to the proper way to write and read " Shimeigatake " ; the GSI lists Shimeigatake / Shimeidake , while " Place Names of Kyoto " lists Shimeigatake and Shimyo no Mine .

Mt . Hiei gets its alternate names , Mt . Tendai and Shimeigatake , from Mt . Tiantai and Mt . Siming , sacred mountains in the People 's Republic of China that have associations with the Tendai Sect .

Geography

Mt . Hiei Viewed from the Side ( left side )

The Tanba plateau and the Hira mountain region are separated by the Hanaore fault .

For this reason , it is considered to belong to the Hiei mountain region , or the Hiei Daigo mountain region .

The 53 stations of the Tokaido Road ( Tokaido gojusan tsugi ) can mean :

The 53 posting stations on the Tokaido Road , which connected Edo ( Nihonbashi ( Chuo Ward , Tokyo ) and Kyoto ( Sanjo Ohashi Bridge ) during the Edo period .

To be explained in this section .

The ukiyoe works painted by Hiroshige UTAGAWA depicted 53 posting stations ( or 55 , including the starting / ending stations ) .

The 53 stations of the Tokaido Road ( a game )

The " 53 stations " of the Tokaido Road refers to 53 stations in ' Tokaido Road , ' which is the major road running through the Tokaido region and is among five provinces and seven circuits ( Gokishichido ) .

Many of the 53 stations are established in places where the scenery is beautiful , or in famous historic spots , and often served as the subjects of ukiyoe or waka / haiku .

Furthermore , when it is called 53 stations it refers to the road up to Kyoto , but when referring to the road up to Osaka the term 57 stations is used .

From here onward we will categorize them according to their respective provinces .

Serial numbers are used , starting at Shinagawa-juku Station .

Sanjo-Ohashi Bridge ( Higashiyama Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture )

According to one theory , Ieyasu TOKUGAWA set the number of stations from Edo ( Kanji characters with the same sound , 穢土 , meaning unclean land ) to Kyo ( which means the land where Fugen Bosatsu ( 普賢菩薩 ) lives ) , based on a chapter from Kegon-kyo Sutra , in which Zenzai-doshi ( 善財童子 ) of ' Nyuhokkaibon ( 入法界品 ) , ' following the orders of Monju Bosatsu , achieved enlightenment at the place of Fugen Bosatsu , through 53 teachers .

As an extension of the Tokaido Road , the stations of the Kyokaido Road ( Osaka Kaido Road ) were established in 1619 .

In some cases the stations of the Kyokaido Road are included and are collectively referred to as the 57 stations of the Tokaido Road .

Furthermore , when entering the Kyokaido Road from the Tokaido Road , Sanjo-Ohashi Bridge will not be crossed , and the route taken will turn southwest at Higechaya-oiwake ( 髭茶屋追分 ) ( Oiwake-cho , Otsu City ) , so the station following Otsu-juku Station will be Fushimi-juku Station .

These will be categorized according to their respective provinces .

The first number is based on the country .

The second number is a serial number , starting with Shinagawa-juku Station .

54 . Fushimi-juku Station ( Kyo Kaido Road ) ( Fushimi Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture )

55 . Yodo-juku Station ( Fushimi Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture )

Korai-bashi Bridge ( Chuo Ward , Osaka City , Osaka Prefecture )

Note : It was formerly Kyobashi Bridge ( a bridge over Neyagawa-river , which is located between the Chuo and Miyakojima Wards of Osaka City , Osaka Prefecture ) .

" The Pillow Book " is a zuihitsu essay ( literally , " random jottings " ) , which is said to have been written by Sei Shonagon , a female writer who lived in the mid-Heian period .

The title was also written using Chinese characters such as ' 枕草紙 ' ( Makurazoshi Notebook ) , ' 枕冊子 ' ( Makura Sasshi ) , ' 枕双紙 ' ( Makura soshi ) , and ' 春曙抄 ' ( Shunsho-sho Commentary ) , and the oldest manuscript ( called " maedabon " in Japanese ) , a copy of which was made in the Kamakura period , has a gold-lacquered casket with the Chinese characters " 清少納言枕草子 " ( Sei Shonagon , The Pillow Book ) written on it .

It was also called " Sei Shonagon ki . "

Together with " The Tale of Genji , " this book is considered one of the twin masterpieces of Heian literature , and it had a great influence on the Renga ( linked verse ) , Haikai ( seventeen-syllable verse ) , and Kanazoshi ( old stories witten in the kana script ) that followed .

Along with both " Hojo-ki ( The Ten-Foot-Square Hut ) , " written by KAMO no Chomei , and " Tsurezuregusa ( Essays in Idleness ) " written by Kenko YOSHIDA , it is called one of the three Japanese major lists , histories and satires .

Its writing style is extremely individualistic : there is no similar book except " Gizan-zassan ( Gizan Collection ) , " compiled by Shangyin LI ( courtesy name Yishan ) , a poet of the late Tang dynasty .

According to an afterword to the book , her motive for writing the book and the origin of the title came from the episode in which , when Naidaijin ( minister of the center ) FUJIWARA no Korechika presented to his younger sister FUJIWARA no Empress Teishi and Emperor Ichijo a bundle of paper , which was still expensive in those days , the Empress inquired , ' Emperor used the paper to copy " Shiki ( Records of the Grand Historian ) , ' what do you think we could write on this ? " to which Sei Shonagon answered , ' it ( the book ) would be good to use as a pillow . '

She was granted the paper ( such episode being based on Sankanbon ( version of manuscript ) , and both incomplete and complete versions of Noinbon ( version of manuscript ) have similar episodes describing the response that " it ( the book ) would be good to use as a pillow ) , " but the Sakaibon and Maedabon ( versions of the manuscript ) don 't contain this episode ) .

It is widely thought that the title ' The Pillow Book ' is also based on the episode .

" A study of the Pillow Book " written by Kazuhiko HAYASHI mentions his own view and some other past scholars ' names such as Keichu , Shinobu ORIKUCHI , and Kikan IKEDA .

The following are typical views about the meaning of " pillow " :

― Bedding : a pun that suggests a pillow on the mattress ( with Shiki reworded as Shikibuton ( mattress ) ) .

― Dictionary for the writer : There are many chapters in which Utamakura ( a place famed in poetry ) , rules , and terms are listed .

― Memorandum : She kept the paper by her pillow for private jottings .

― Treasured book

― Irrelevant to anything

However , scholars have yet to reach a consensus .

Also , in the book of " Eiga monogatari ( A Tale of Flowering Fortunes ) , " the term ' makura no soshi ' as a common noun was used to describe the beautiful kasane ( layering ) colors .

According to the afterword , the first draft was written around 996 , and Sachujo ( guard of the Imperial Palace ) MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa took the draft from the author 's residence and brought it before the eyes of the world .

After that , she wrote continuously , and some records say the book was written around 1012 .

Some lines of " The Pillow Book , " as quoted from the old commentary " Shimei-sho Commentary of ' The Tale of Genji , ' " don 't exist in the surviving manuscript , which suggests that the writing process was complicated .

There are great differences between the existing manuscripts .

It consists of three volumes and takes the form of a collection of various writings .

It is a manuscript containing an okugaki ( postscript ) written in 1228 by a person called Bogyuguo , who seems to have been FUJIWARA no Sadaie .

It is ' clear writing ' and is easy to understand , being considered the most similar to the original form .

It was divided into two groups by Kikan IKEDA .

Korui ( first class ) - The opening 70 chapters , which start with the line , ' The best time in spring is dawn , ' are omitted , and instead the manuscript begins with the line , ' Comfortable thing . '

230 chapters

Book collection of Yomei paperback , book collection of Toshoryo , Shoryo Department , Imperial Household Agency , and book collection of the Tatamatsunomiya faamily

Otsurui ( second class ) - 300 chapters

Old book collection of Hamao YATOMI , book collection of Kariya City Library , old book collection of the Date family , old book collection of the KAJUJI Family , old book collection of Akika NAKAMURA , book collection of Koshido Bunko

The priest Noin was related by marriage to Sei Shonagon ( one of his sisters was a wife of TACHIBANA no Norinaga , a son of Sei Shonagon ) , and seemed to have something to do with handing down the manuscript .

The date of the work has been traced back to the end of the Kamakura period .

After arguing which book is more authentic , it is now widely accepted that the original book of Noinbon is inferior to Sankanbon .

Two hundred and thirty chapters ( excluding the first 70 chapters )

300 chapters

Ruisan form ( a classified collection in book form )

Manuscript copied in the Muromachi period

The postscript says KIYOHARA no Shigekata / Edakata copied the book , whose owner was Doha , a secluded monk who lived in Sakai , and therefore the manuscript is called Sakaibon .

Two volumes

The book is missing chapters on diary and reminiscence .

Gokogoninbon ( type of manuscript ) : 190 chapters

The postscript says Emperor Go-Kogon made a copy of the book .

Shinkanbon ( a manuscript in the Emperor 's own hand )

Ninety-five chapters

The above two types of manuscripts were integrated into a book .

Sakaibon in general refers to this .

Volume 1 consists of 107 chapters .

Volume 2 consists of 89 chapters .

Volume 3 consists of 102 chapters .

Volume 4 consists of 32 chapters .

Volume 5 might have been lost .

It takes Ruisan form .

There exists only one manuscript that has been handed down in the Maeda family of Kaga Province ( the book collection of MAEDA-Ikutokukai ) .

It is preserved in a box of gold-lacquered craft , and on its surface are the characters " 清少納言枕草子 ( Sei Shonagon , The Pillow Book ) " in gold incrustation .

It is an important cultural property .

It was copied during the early Kamakura period and is considered to be the oldest of all the manuscripts of " The Pillow Book . "

Among them , the Sakaibon group Gokogoninbon was separately collected in two volumes of " Gunshoruiju ( Japanese history book ) , " and three kinds of Sakaibon were collected in " Shinko Gunshoruiju ( library ) . "

Additionally , Noinbon was used as a master copy in making the old plate of type in the early Edo period ; therefore , it remained a dominant manuscript along with " The Pillow Book Bochu ( marginal notes ) " and " Shunsho-sho Commentary of The Pillow Book " ( annotated by Kigin KITAMURA ) until modern times .

However , in 1946 , when Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917-1987 ) reevaluated the second class of Sankanbon , it came to be considered more important and was published more , being used as a textbook and read at school after the war .

Other existent manuscripts are seven chapters of " The Pillow Book Ekotoba ( story in pictures ) " made in the late Kamakura period , consisting of emaki ( a picture scroll ) with hakubyoga ( ink line painting ) , and Sankanbon manuscript seems to have been used for the notes .

The second-class Sankanbon contains more than 300 independent chapters in total .

It consists of various types of writing : ' chapters of Ruiju ' of ' Monowazukushi ( enumerating the things in the same category ) , ' as represented by the lists of things like ' Insects , ' ' Flowering trees , ' ' Dispiriting things , ' ' Endearingly lovely things , ' and ' Chapters of Zuiso ( essay ) , ' which is an observation of daily life and nature in the seasons , and ' chapters of reminiscence ( chapters of a diary ) ' in which the author wrote about the life around Empress Teishi , whom she served in the Imperial Court .

However , some chapters are too obscure to be classified ( for example the first chapter , entitled , ' The best time in spring is dawn , ' is generally classified into the chapters of Zuiso , but some people disagree ) .

It was written in the plain vernacular using Hiragana ( the Japanese cursive syllabary ) , and most of the chapters were written in a witty style , but sometimes sentimental lamentation appears reflecting the fall of the Michitaka FUJIWARA 's family and unhappiness gone through by her majesty Empress Teishi .

The author 's sophisticated taste was in harmony with a keen observation on things , generating the intellectual aesthetic world of ' wokashi ( amusing or delightful ) ' in contrast with the emotional ' mono no aware ( pathos ) ' of " The Tale of Genji . "

When  low  carbon  content   in  steel  samples  is  analyzed   by   the  combustion type infrared  absorption   method ,  standard   specimens   of different   carbon  contents  are   used   for   calibration .

In this   case ,   there   are   discrepancies in  the analysis   data  and   the  certified   data .

In  the   present   investigation ,   comparison   of  the analysis   data  is  made   with  standard   sample   of   high   carbon  content ,   JSS 57 ‐ 6 / C : 0 .   52 % )   and  low  carbon  content ,   LSS 1203 ‐ 2 / C : 0 .   0096 % ) .   The analysis   value   of  the  high   concentration  standard   is   out   of  the  true   value   considerably ,   and   the analysis   value   of  the low content standard   are   nearer   to  the  true   value .

Thus ,   the low content standard   is  used   for   the  calibration   for   conducting   analyses  of  ultra ‐low  carbon   samples  and   the   results  are   satisfactory   with   good   reproducibility .

The   authors  examined  the  effects  of   CO2   saturation   pressure   on  nanofoams   in  the   foam   molding   of block - copolymer  ( PS - PFMA )   between  styrene   and   perfluorooctylethyl  methacrylate   u sing   supercritical   CO2 .

They annealed  the thin  films   of   PS - PFMA  synthesized through   continuous  anionic   polymerization ,   at   60 ℃   and   7 . 5 - 30   MPa   of   CO2   saturation   pressure   for   1   h ,   and   successively  depressured   them at   0 ℃   at   a   rate   of   0 . 5   MPa/min   to  carry   out   foam   molding .

As  a   result ,   PFMA   domain functioned  as  a template   of   foam   formation ,   since   CO2  existed in  the  globular   PFMA   domain   of   10   nm  order   of   parent   CO2   property .

The   average  diameter   of  the   foaming   cells   was   10 - 30   nm ,   and  it  increased  up  to   reaching   20   MPa ,   and  it  lowered   afterwards .

In  the ellipsometer   measurement   before   and   after  the   foaming   of   PS - PFMA ,   refractive   index  lowered  and   the  volume percentage   of   foaming   cells  increased ,   when   CO2   pressure  increased .

The   authors  examined  the   " ethanol   macroclusters "   formed  on   glass  sphere   surface   in  an  ethanol / cyclohexane   binary   liquid ,   u sing   1 H - NMR   spectroscopy .

Regarding   the  cases  of absence   and   presence   of  glass  spheres  in  an  ethanol  / deuterated  cyclohexane   binary   liquid ,   the   authors   measured   the   chemical   shift   of  the   proton   of  mainly  OH ,   CH 2   andCH 3 .

The   results   showed  that   the  spectra   originated   from  ethanol   molecule   in  bulk   phase   received   the  effect   of  the   addition   of  glass  spheres ,   and   at about   2   mol %  ethanol   concentration   with   the   addition   of  glass  spheres ,  the   resonance   line   of  the   proton   of   OH   and   CH 2  widened and  it   was  further   divided .

It   was   suggested   from  this   fact  that   2   kinds  of  ethanol   clusters  existed in   high  ethanol   concentrations   with   the  existence   of  glass  spheres ,   and   the   exchange   of  ethanol   molecules   between  the  clusters   of   surface   and  bulk  occurred .

As  a   part   of  the environment   harmony type  catalyst   development ,   here   were   prepared  inorganic/organic  hybrid   catalysts  by   fixing   organic groups onto   silicates  with   various   regularity ,   to   investigate  their  catalytic   performance .

Here   were   investigated  post -synthesis   treatment  and  organic group   modification   of boro - silicate type  of   MCM - 22   ( MWW ) .

This   MWW   is  zeolite  with  independent  two kinds  of  two- dimensional  ten - member  cycle  fine - pore   and   twelve - member  cycle   supercage ,   and  its   product   direct   after  its crystallization   forms  a   laminer   precursor ,   to   form  an   MWW  structure  by  its   sintering   which   generates a  bowl type  twelve - member  cycle   pocket at  its   outer   surface   by  exposing   a   supercage  after  its   peeling - off   with   laminer  state .

And ,  it   is   thought  that   proximity   of  the  pocket  constructs  coupling   portions   of  the organic group   capable   of   u sing  it   for   reaction   with   big matrices .

Furthermore ,  it   can   be  expected  further   high   performance   of this   catalyst   by  increasing  its   outer   areas  through  its   laminer   peeling   and  fine grinding .

The   authors  found  that  urethane  synthesis   from  cyclic   amine   was   possible   u sing   quarternary   ammonium  salt   as  an   ionic   liquid .

As   a   starting   point   which   forms  the  political  intention  that   adjusts  and   integrates  ocean   policy   of  basin   countries   for  enhancing  ocean   goveranc   of  the   Asia   sea   region ,it   is  necessary  to  carry   out  the  common  un derstanding   in  which  the  sea  in   Asia   has   geographic   characteristics   of  the  semi - enclosure  sea .

The  semi - enclosure  sea   is   very   weak   in  ecologically  and   environmentally .

It   is   the  sea  area   w here   integrated   management   is   the   most   difficult .

Then ,   new  concept  of  ocean   governance   and   Securing   the  Ocean   are   introduced  in   order   to   form  the  political  intention  to  the integrated   management ,   and   they  should   aim at unity   of  the  marine   information   of  each   country .

It   has   been  indicated  that   integration   of   information   is  necessary   for   the  effective   policy   decision   of  the  ocean   management   in   PEMSEA   (   Partnership in   Enviromental   Management   for   the   East   Asia   ) .

The   recognition   on  the  ocean   of  the  inhabitant   of  the coast   society   is  integrated and   is   adjusted ,   and  it   is   to   foster  the  political  intention   by   changing   the   frame  of  the  politics  decision   there .

This   report  is   a   result   of   a  study  carried  out   in   1988 . In   chapter   I ,  the   following   were   outlined : landforms  including   the  sea  bottom around   Nijima Island   and   Shikineshima Island ,   characteristics   of  the   geology ,   and   rocks ,   and   the  history   of  eraptions   from   the  viewpoint   of  eruption   by‐products .

An  estimation   of un derground   structures   by  electrical   survey  and   artificial  earthquakes are   being   tried  in   Nijima Island .

In   order   to  elucidate  atmosphere   ‐  ocean  exhange   of  the carbon dioxide .

The  lines  of  discontinuity   were   observed  in  the   partial   pressure   of   carbon dioxide  in  the  sea   water   near  the  boundaries   among  each  sea  area .

As  a   cause   of  these   phenomena ,  it  seems  that   the  water   masses  with  rare   horizontal  transfer  and   vertical   mixing   exist   in   contact  each  other   and  an   original   carbon  cycle   is   working   in  each   water   mass   by   the  biological   activity .

From   the  calculations   of   CO2   concentrations ,  it   was   found  that   Bingo‐ Nada   and   Bingo‐ Seto   were   the  emitters  and   Harima‐ Hada   was  the absorber   of   carbon dioxide .

At   present ,  improvement   of   wetland   environment   becomes urgent .

Improvement   and   conservation   of   aqueous  environment  are   an  essential  theme  for   the  conservation   of   wetland s ,   and   in   order   to   make  plans   for   conservation ,  it   is  necessary  to   determine   the   wetland   water   balance .

For   Akai‐Yachi   wetland ,   the  water   balance   was  examined  basing   on  the   measurement   results  of  the  runoff   from   wetland   and   on  the   meteorological   data .

As  a   result ,  it   was  confirmed  that   the rainfall  losses   were   mostly  caused   by  evapotranspiration  and   that   the drought in  1994   brought about  the   change   in  the  runoff   characteristics   of   wetland .

A   region   referred  to   as  the  thermal  internal   boundary   layer   ( TIBL )   in  which  the  convection   mixing   is   active   appears   on  the   land   due   to  the temperature gradient   between  the   land   surface   (  higher  temperature  )   and   the  sea   surface   (  lower temperature  )   when  the wind blows   from   the  sea  toward  the   land .

When   TIBL   is   developed ,   a   smoke   source   is   present   on  the  sea  or   close   to  the   shore ,   and   contaminants  are   dischraged   from   the   smoke   source ,   the diff usion   process   is  interfered   by   TIBL ,   and   a   phenomenon   (  fumigation   phenomenon   )  occurs  in  which  the  high   concentration   appears  near  the ground   level .

The  atmospheric  diff usion   phenomenon   of  the  contaminants taking   into  consideration  the  TIBL   is   reproduced   u sing   the wind   channel ,   and   the   measured   values   were   compared   with   the   results  of  the numerical   calculation  and   the   results  of  the   measurement   at   site .

The   result   shows good   agreement .

" MOS "   of  Oika   Development   Laboratory   is   a   12 m thick   PET  film   on  which   silicon  oxide  is   deposited  with  thickness   of   30 ‐ 8 ‐ nm   by   vacuum   metallization technique .

There   are   two types ,   MOS ‐ TB   ( boil   and   general  uses )   and   MOS ‐ TR   ( retort use ) .

A  point   to   note  in   processing   is   that  it   is  necessary  to  cover   by   metallization technique   the  silicon  oxide  layer  with  another   layer  before   preparation   of   a  composite  material   from  it ,   since  the  silicon  oxide  film   is   vulnerable .

Dry   lamination   is   recommended to   be   preferable  in   lamination   method .

Medium  composition  and  fungus  selection   of   Hatakeshimeji  were   examined .

Among   13   kinds  of   culture   media   in  which   culture   medium  materials   were   combined ,  colony  diameter   was  the  largest   in  the  case   of   4 : 4 : 4 : 2   (  or ,   1   )   of   sawdust ,  corn cob ,  orga ,  rice   bran .

The  sawdust   of   a  conifer   was   better  than  that   of  broad ‐ leaved  tree .

Form   and  yield   of   fruit  body   were   different   among   7   systems  in  fungus  selection   and  it   was   regarded  that   a  wide - mouthed  bottle   presenting   a  big  aperture  was   suitable   for   the  cultivation   of   Hatakeshimeji.

Sood   sprayer   is  a  necessary   machine   for   fruit  cultivation  including   apple ,  but ,  a   chemical   exposure  to  an  operator  during   pesticide  spraying   work   becomes a   problem .

There fore ,  an  induction   cable unmanned  pest   control   robot   for   fruit   tree   was   developed .

At   the  location   away   from   the unmanned  pest   control   robot ,   the   following   are   carried  out   by   a   support  remote  operation  unit  :  Start  and  stop   of  the   robot ,  drive   of   air blower  and  stop ,  start   of  the   chemicals  dissemination  and  stop .

It   is  equipped  with   safety  device   such   as   automatic   shut‐ down  device   for   running   and   disseminator   in   case   of  the  obstacle  detection ,   and   automatic   shut‐ down  device   for   the engine   in   case   of  the  obstacle  contact .

In   a   dwelling   house   in   Hokkaido  of   which   high   thermal   insulation  and   high   air tightness  are   required ,  the window to   be  an   opening   is   also  required  to   be   upgraded in  thermal   insulation ,   dew prevention ,   air tightness ,   water tightness  and   wind   resistance .

A   wooden   sash  satisfying   this   performance   is   developed .

The  purpose   is   achieved   by   devising   " a   pressing   mechanism   for   fixture  by  a  pin   and   a taper "   and   making   the   sash into   double sliding   system .

The window  is  made   double ,  an   aluminum   sash   for   outside  and   a   wooden   sash   for   inside .

Purposes   were  male   exclusive   production technique   and   breeding   of   superior   character   on   Tilapia   whose  male grows   faster .

The  ratio   of  female   of  T . niloticus   of   95 . 6 %   was  obtained   by   adding   estrone   to  feed .

It   was   recognized  that  warming   treatment   for   4   minutes tended to   have   higher   hatchability  in gynogenesis  inducing   test   by blocking   first   cleavage  u sing   T . niloticus   and   T . aureus .

In   addition ,  it   was  examined   whether gynogenesis  induction   was   successful or   not   by  judgement   of  sex   reversed  female  and   isozyme analysis .

Development   is   completed   for   a   circulating type  dryer   which   can   perform  drying   work   of grains   such   as  rice   and   wheat   at  the speed  of   0 . 4 %  or   more   by  utilization   of   infrared   ray   radiated   from   heating   of   far  infrared   ray   radiator   and   residual   heat   from   radiator   heating ,   and   a   prototype   is   being   produced .

For   the  far  infrared   radiator ,  a  base   metal   such   as  stainless steel coated  with  infrared   ray   radiation   agent   was   adopted ,   and   U‐shape   is   adopted to   reduce   unevenness   of energy .

Kerosene   combustion   is  used   for   heating   of  the  radiator .

The  design  conditions   are   so  determined  that   the loading   capacity   should   be  2000 kg ,  drying   rate   0 . 6 % / h,   and   the  radiator   surface   temperature   330 ℃ .
