The collection will take the form of an analogous compilation.

There is only a copy of this book (owned by the Maeda Ikutoku-kai), which was handed down from the Maeda family in Kaga Province.

It is housed in a gold makie lacquer-work box with the inscription "The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon" inlaid in gold on the box.

It is an important cultural property.

This copy from the early Kamakura period (1185-1333) is said to be the oldest manuscript of the Pillow Book.

Of these, the Sakai-bon series Gokōgenin-bon is included in the Gunshō Ruyuu in upper and lower volumes, and the three Sakai-bon types are included in the Shinkyō Gunshō Ruyuu.

In addition, since the Nouin version was used as the bottom copy in old printed editions in the early Edo period (Kan'ei era), it was combined with annotations such as "Pillow and Pillowside Notes" and "Pillow and Pillow, Spring Daybreak" (notes by Kitamura Kigin), and became a mainstream tradition in the modern era.

However, in 1946, Shigetaro Tanaka (1917-1987) reevaluated the three-volume second series, and after World War II, these were the only ones published and used as textbooks.

In addition, there is a seven-section scroll of "Pillow and Pillow Texts," a white illustrated scroll from the late Kamakura period (1185-1333), which appears to have used a three-volume version of the text of the lyrics.

The three-volume second series has more than 300 independent chapters.

The "Ruiju Chodan" is composed of a variety of passages, including "Ruju Chodan," which is a collection of "things" represented by "Insects," "Flowers," "Wonderful things," and "Beautiful things," "Zazo Chodan," which describes the author's daily life and observations of nature in the four seasons, and "Kaiso Chodan" (diary), which looks back on courtly society in the days around Empress Sadako when the author served in the imperial court.

However, some chapters are ambiguous in their classification (e.g., the first paragraph "Spring is Akebono" is classified as an essay, but there are objections to this classification).

The stories are written in a concise, colloquial Japanese style using hiragana, and are generally light-hearted and short, but sometimes contain a hint of sentimentality, reflecting the downfall of the Chūkanpaku family and the misfortune that befell Empress Sadako, the sovereign of the Chūkanpaku family.

The author's refined sense and keen eye for detail combined to create an aesthetic world of intellectual "hakashi" in contrast to the emotional "mono no ahare" of "The Tale of Genji".

Positive Evaluation

Because Makura-no-Soshi deeply loved both human existence and nature, she enjoyed and formed them into various kinds of beauty in their respective phases (Mekada, Sakuo).

The threads of associations that flow from one chapter to the next allow for a rich variety of material to be presented in each section, without distinction between analogy, reminiscence, and recollection, in a way that is as freely expressed as a horse flying through the sky (Ogiya, Park).

The expression of "season - time" (e.g., Akebono for spring) is a novel one that follows the common cycle of "spring - flower - morning" found in the Kokinshu of those days, but omits the intermediary term "wind" as a challenge to the rigidity of the aesthetic consciousness of readers who are familiar with the waka tradition (Munetoshi Fujimoto).

This is an expression of his respect for Sadako Nakamiya.

It was written to quiet the soul of Sadako, who had collapsed in the midst of the misfortune of the decline of the Michitaka family.

Therefore, it is not surprising that the decline of the Michitaka family is not mentioned (Ibid.).

The chapters that appear to be self-praise stories also emphasize that Chugu and the people around her lived in a world of beauty and loftiness, free from politics, by the grace of the emperor, even in a time of disappointment (Uenori).

Critical Evaluation

It is a manifestation of Sei Shonagon's shallow attempt to forget his native class and assimilate into the upper class (Ken Akiyama).

(Because they lack honorifics not only for their own relatives but also for those of higher status)

It is merely a "record of the civilization of the palace of Sadako," and was not written with the qualifications of an "individual" (Joji Ishida).

Tokugawa Yoshinobu Tokugawa Yoshihisa (徳川 慶喜, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, or Tokugawa Yoshihisa) was the 15th barbarian shogun of the Edo shogunate (reigned from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867, according to the old calendar).

He was the only shogun who did not perform his duties as shogun at Edo Castle.

The Minister of the Interior is an Isao First Duke.

House of Peers ( Japan ).

He became the 15th Shogun of the Edo Shogunate after the death of the 14th Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi, who had served as the Shogun's guardian.

After returning the power to Emperor Meiji (= Daisei Honkan), he aimed for a combination of public and military power, but after the restoration of the monarchy (in Japan), he returned to Edo Castle from Osaka Castle with the former shogunate forces, received an order from the Imperial Court to take refuge there, and opened Edo Castle without bloodshed.

After his house arrest was lifted in the Meiji era (1868-1912), he devoted himself to hobbies and lived as a duke until the Taisho era (1912-1926).

Keiki" is also read as "Yoshinobu" or, more commonly, as "Keiki" (read as "有職").

During the Shogun's tenure, there are records in official documents of the Edo shogunate stating that he read the name "Yoshihisa.

The name "Yoshihisa" can still be seen in the alphabetical signature and in English newspapers.

In his hometown of Mito, he is often called "Yoshinobu," but in Shizuoka City, where he spent the rest of his life, he is often called "Keiki.

According to those who knew Keiki during his lifetime, he preferred to be called "Keiki-sama," and even referred to himself as "Keiki" in a telegram sent to his younger brother Tokugawa Akitake.

Tokugawa Keikyu, who succeeded Keiki, is said to have been called "Keikyu-sama" by the people around him, just as Keiki was.

The two ways of calling people "Mr. Keiki" and "Ms. Keiki" can be confirmed and are becoming less common in modern times, but "Ms. Keiki" can be found in many places, not only in Shizuoka, and is often used in a "very friendly" manner in both cases.

According to Ryotaro Shiba, "People who call themselves 'Keiki' tend to come from families related to former shogunate vassals," but the fact that the name was also used by people related to the Higo clan, which worked to overthrow the shogunate, suggests that Keiki may have been admired or favored by a wide range of people.

Born on September 29, 1837, at the Mito Domain residence in Koishikawa, Edo, the seventh son of the ninth lord Tokugawa Saliaki.

His mother was Queen Yoshiko, a shogun whose mother was a daughter of the third Tokugawa Iemitsu.

(Although Iemitsu's birth mother is ostensibly his father Hidetada's wife, Ooe no Mata, there is a theory that Kasuga no Okocha was his real mother.

His childhood name was Shichirou Umaro.

In accordance with the educational policy of Hitoshiaki that "boys should be brought up in the country," he moved to Mito at the age of seven months and spent most of his time there until he succeeded to the Ichihashi Tokugawa family, where he received academic and martial arts instruction from Aizawa Shoshisai and others.

At the time, Yoshinobu's heroic spirit was highly regarded, and initially, Hitoshiaki did not want to adopt Yoshinobu to another family, but instead wanted to keep her son, Tokugawa Keiatsu, as an antechamber to his eldest son (heir).

On August 1, 1847, the Shogunate ordered the Mito domain to appoint Shichiromaro as the successor of the Hitotsubashi family.

In December, he was given the name of "Keiki" by the 12th Shogun, Tokugawa Iekei, and took the name of "Keiki".

Iyei often visited the residence of Hitotsubashi and considered Keiki as a strong candidate to succeed the Shogun, but decided against it after receiving an admonition from Abe Masahiro, the chief retainer of the shogunate.

In 1853, during the confusion caused by the arrival of the black ships, Shogun Iekei died of illness, and his successor, the 13th Shogun Tokugawa Iesada, was too sickly to father a son, so the question of who would succeed the Shogun arose (the Shogun Succession Problem).

The Hitotsubashi faction, which included such figures as Hitoshiaki, Abe Masahiro, and Shimazu Saibira, the feudal lord of Satsuma, who favored Keiki, and the Nanki faction, which included Ii Naosuke, the feudal lord of Hikone, who favored Tokugawa Keifuku, and Iesada's mother, Honjuin, who favored the feudal lord of Kishu, were at odds.

The Hitotsubashi faction tried to support the shogun by sending his adopted daughter, Tenshakuin, to the inner palace as the shogun and his wife, but they lost momentum after the deaths of Abe Masahiro and Shimazu Yoshiakira, and in 1858, when Ii Naosuke became the Grand Councilor, he decided that Tokugawa Keifuku would succeed as the shogun's successor.

In the same year, Ii Naosuke signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States "without imperial sanction.

However, he was accused of the same crime and was placed under house arrest the following year in 1859 (Ansei no Daigaku).

He sent a letter to Hitoshi saying, "I am sorry for your trouble, but it is better not to take the reins than to fail after taking the reigns of the Shogunate.

In 1860, his house arrest was lifted.

In 1862, the imperial envoy Shigenori Ohara, escorted by Satsuma clan soldiers led by Hisamitsu Shimazu, entered Edo, where he received an imperial order from Emperor Koaki to appoint Keiki Tokugawa to the post of guardian of the shogunate and Harutake Matsudaira (Keinaga) to that of grand elder.

On July 6, the shogunate appointed Keiki to the post of guardian of the shogunate and Shungaku to the post of president of the government.

Yoshinobu and Shungaku implemented the "Bunkyu Reforms," or reforms of the shogunate, including the establishment of the position of Kyoto Protector and the relaxation of the system of alternation of court attendance.

In 1863, he moved to Kyoto as a pioneer of the shogun Tokugawa Iemochi, and devoted himself to negotiating with the imperial court, which was pressing for the exclusion of the barbarians.

Emperor Kōmei had to cancel his visit to Ishimizu Hachiman Shrine to pray for the exclusion of the barbarians, and since Iemochi would be forced to exclude the barbarians if he received a sword from the Emperor, he had to cancel his audience with Iemochi on the grounds that he had a "cold and fever" (a temporary illness).

After the August 18 political upheaval that ousted the Emperor's exclusionist faction led by the Choshu clan, he again went to Kyoto to participate in the council of advisers organized by the Kōbukyō and Sakujō factions.

When he saw that the meeting could not reach a consensus, he intentionally got drunk with Prince Asahiko Kuwani and others, abused Date Muneaki, Matsudaira Harutake, and Shimazu Hisamitsu, and verbally abused Nakagawa by saying, "How much are you getting from Shimazu? He also verbally abused the Nakagawa family, asking them how much money they were getting from Shimazu, and thus disrupted the regime.

Thereafter, he remained in Kyoto and was appointed by the Imperial Court as Governor-General of the Forbidden Imperial Palace, and together with his guard, Matsudaira no Hiroyasu (lord of the Aizu domain) and Tokoroji Sadataka Matsudaira (lord of the Kuwana domain), he was responsible for the control of the Imperialists and court nobles (the Ichikaigwa (Hitotsubashi, Aizu, Kuwana) system).

During the Tengu Rebellion, he showed his cool-headedness in cutting off the supporters of Keiki, such as Takeda Kounsai and his family's vassals in the Mito domain.

In 1864, he led the Shogunate forces in the Revolt at the Forbidden Gate and personally attacked the Choshu forces that had occupied the Takasi residence.

After the first conquest of Choshu, he worked hard to obtain an imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States, which had been unauthorized, and succeeded in obtaining it with conditions attached.

In the second conquest of Chōshū in 1866, Keiki obtained an imperial order to conquer Chōshū over the obstructions of the Satsuma Clan.

However, the Bakufu forces were defeated, partly due to the Satsuma Clan's refusal to join the Satsuma-Naga Alliance.

On July 20, in the midst of the second Choshu conquest, Shogun Iemochi died at Osaka Castle.

Keiki exercised his authority at the Imperial Court to issue an imperial edict of truce, and succeeded in concluding an armistice agreement.

He was nominated as Iemochi's successor, but Keiki declined the nomination.

On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun succeeded to the shogunate, but refused to assume the post of shogun.

The old lieutenant and others then begged him to assume the post of shogun, but he did not accept, and on December 5, he was proclaimed shogun by the Emperor Ko-ming and assumed the post of shogun.

This was a way of selling his favors and becoming a general in order to advance his political career.

Keiki received $2.4 million in aid from France through French Minister Léon Roche, established the Yokosuka Ironworks and Shipbuilding & Repair Works, and invited military advisors such as Jules Brunet to reform the military system.

He also encouraged his younger brother Tokugawa Akitake to study abroad in Europe, including sending him to the Universal Exposition in Paris.

In the issue of the opening of the port of Hyogo, he persistently persuaded the Imperial Court to give its approval.

Anticipating the "secret edict to defeat the shogunate" against Satsuma, Keiki made a preemptive move on October 14, Keio 3 (1867), to request the Imperial Court to return the power to the shogunate, which was granted on the following day (Dasei Bokan).

It is said that the Imperial Court at that time was not capable of administration, and sought to continue the Tokugawa regime under the leadership of the Council of Princes.

However, under the plans of Okubo Toshimichi and Iwakura Tomomi, who aimed to overthrow the shogunate, a great decree for the restoration of the monarchy was issued in December, and Keiki was ordered to resign from his post and give up his lands (resignation from the position of Minister of the Interior and dedication of the Tokugawa domain).

To avoid conflict, Yoshinobu retreated to Osaka Castle, where he gathered foreign ambassadors to assert Tokugawa's legitimacy. He also made a motion to the Imperial Court to modify his official resignation to a more peaceful form.

However, in the following year, 1868, the Satsuma Clan, in response to a provocation in Edo, raised an army and blockaded Kyoto with soldiers from the Aizu and Kuwana Clans.

However, when the battle of Toba and Fushimi broke out on January 3, the former Shogunate forces were at a disadvantage, and even though they still had sufficient forces, they left their troops behind and retreated to Edo on the Kaiyomaru, a military report.

Soon after, an order was issued to pursue Keiki as an enemy of the shogunate, and a government army led by the Grand Viceroy Prince Sujin of Arisugawa began an expedition to the east.

Yoshinobu suppressed the anti-war faction led by Oguri Tadasun, and insisted on reverence.

In February, he left the management of the situation to Kaishu Katsu, and he himself was placed under house arrest at the Daichi-in Temple in Kan-eiji, Ueno.

The Tokugawa Soke family passed the reigns to his adopted son, Kaminosuke TAYASU (later to become Ietatsu TOKUGAWA).

After negotiations between Katsu and Saigo Takamori, the chief of staff of the government forces, were concluded and Edo Castle was opened without bloodshed, Keiki was transferred to Mito and remained under house arrest in a room at the Koudoukan, the domain school.

In July, he moved to Sunpu, to which the Tokugawa family had been transferred.

41st year of the Meiji era (1908)

On April 30, he is awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Meiji government for his services in restoring the Meiji Restoration.

On December 8, he retired.

He died on November 22 (4:10 a.m.) in the second year of the Taisho era (1913).

On the same day, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, Paulownia.

He was born and raised in the best environment for learning the martial arts and sciences, and among the various martial arts, he was an avid fan and expert in the art of Te-ura-senjutsu.

Even after the restoration of the Grand Seikan, he practiced shurikenjutsu every day until his forehead was sweating, and was one of the most famous of all the masters of shurikenjutsu.

He slept with a razor blade on his pillow to correct his bad sleeping position, which his father, Tokugawa no Hitoshi, thought would be a problem when he succeeded to the Tokugawa family (this was only a threat; he would remove the razor blade when he fell asleep to avoid any real injury).

On the other hand, there is an anecdote that he used to share the bed with his wife and two concubines in the shape of a "Y" as a measure against assassination when he was sleeping after coming of age.

Although there is a photograph of Keiki as a child, it is doubtful that it was taken by Keiki himself, as it is believed that photographic equipment was not yet available in Japan when Keiki was a child.

He once visited Iemochi after he fell ill, and they had a normal conversation.

He was known for his heroism and courage, and his father Tokugawa Hitoshi's advisor, Yasujima Obito, described him as "the man who will cleanse the Tokugawa dynasty." With the hope of restoring the Tokugawa shogunate's power, he was crowned shogun and was praised as "the second coming of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

The wisdom of Keiki was well known to the supporters of the overthrow of the shogunate, especially to Kido Takayoshi of the Choshu Clan, who said, "I do not underestimate the gallantry of Hitotsubashi Keiki.

It is as if we are seeing the second coming of Ieyasu," he warned.

In response to the decision to return the Imperial Rule to the Emperor, Ryoma Sakamoto said, "Lord Taiki (Shogun), I understand how you are feeling today.

How dare they refuse? How dare they refuse?

He even gave him a reputation of "I swear to give up my life for the sake of the sovereign" and wanted to give Keiki the position of deputy chief of staff in the new government.

However, it was not until the Meiji period (after Ryoma's death) that Keiki himself learned of Ryoma's existence.

Not only Keiki, but Ryoma's fame during his lifetime was very low compared to that after the Revolution.

Defeated at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he fled back to Edo (now Tokyo) and was widely criticized by his enemies as a "fugitive before the enemy.

Some people ridiculed Keiki's inertia, saying that he had forgotten to leave his gold fan, which had been worn since Ieyasu's death, but that he had always accompanied his favorite concubine.

However, some argue that it was unavoidable at this time because of the need to resist armed revolts in Edo and Musashikuni, the defections of various daimyo (feudal lords) because Keiki had become a sworn enemy, and the need to prevent foreign intervention in the long war that was inevitable even if Osaka Castle could be defended.

As soon as he was declared an enemy of the new government, he was placed under house arrest at Kan'eiji Temple, and was regarded as a man with a good heart who respected the emperor and the imperial court (probably due to his respect for the emperor, Mito Gakko, and the fact that his mother was from the imperial family). He was also said to be "weak-kneed" because he did not take a firm stand against his enemies as a sovereign.

The fact that he was able to transfer power in a state close to that of a bloodless revolution through such measures as reverential respect and the bloodless opening of the Edo castle to the outside world preserved Japan's independence in the modern era, and he was highly praised for his contribution to the Restoration.

Eiichi Shibusawa, a businessman, was a vassal appointed by the Tokugawa family during the reign of Tokugawa Ichihashi, and remained a close friend of the family after the Meiji Restoration.

In the last years of Keiki's life, Shibusawa aimed to compile a biography of Keiki, and he held "old dream meetings" to persuade the reluctant Keiki to speak directly to him.

This is summarized in the "Writing of the Old Dream Society.

In some of the chapters that are recorded in the form of roundtable discussions, we can hear the voice of the aged Keiki, so to speak.

He blamed his age for the war and dodged the question that was inconvenient for him, and his honest words, "I didn't like Shimazu Hisamitsu very much," and "Nabeshima Naomasa was a cheating person," reveal his character and his feelings at the time.

Based on these materials, the Biography of Tokugawa Keiki was completed after Keiki's death.

In order to express his gratitude to Emperor Meiji for pardoning him, who had been considered an enemy of the imperial court, and bestowing upon him the title of "duke," the highest rank of the nobility, Keiki made a will that his funeral should be held in a Shinto ceremony rather than a Buddhist one.

For this reason, Keiki's tomb was not located in the Tokugawa family cemetery at Zojoji Temple or Kan'eiji Temple, but in a circular tomb similar to that of the imperial family at the Yanaka Cemetery.

This is because he was impressed by the simplicity of Emperor Komei's mausoleum ("Biography of Prince Tokugawa Keiki").

Regarding the fact that after the pardon, Keiki was leading a comfortable life without any concern for the former shogunate vassals who had sacrificed their lives for him, Katsushizuka Itakura, an old lieutenant at the time, later stated that he regretted having shared his actions with Keiki.

Although the image of the Tokugawa shogunate as an inert nation was weak due to its "flight before the enemy" at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, its efforts to establish a new modern political system after the Great Restoration have been closely examined in recent years.

Like his father, Hitoshiaki, he was fond of pork from the Satsuma domain and was called "Pugiichisama" (meaning "Pugi Ichisama," or "Pork-loving Hitotsubashi-sama").

In his later years, he enjoyed bread and milk, and developed hobbies such as photography, fishing, spinning, microscopy, and handicrafts (embroidery). During his time as a general, he even learned French from Xi Zhou (an Enlightenment scholar), but failed in his attempts to learn the language.

Although he was a well-known photographer, he did not seem to have developed much in the way of camera skills.

He often submitted his work to photography magazines, but was unable to get it accepted.

His great-grandson Tokugawa Keicho was also a freelance photographer, and he discovered photographs in the Tokugawa Keiki family collection, including those taken by Keiki, which were sorted, edited, and published.

His friend in this hobbyist life was his own brother, Tokugawa Akitake.

On December 3, 1867, he married Ichijo Mikako (changed her name to Mikako after the Restoration).

Mika's eldest daughter (Qiongkoin-dono Ikemizu Kagegen Dai-dojo) was born on July 16, 1772, but died prematurely on July 20.

Thereafter, no more children were born to Mika, and the ten boys and eleven girls born in the Meiji era were all sons and daughters of the two side wives.

These include the seventh son, Yoshihisa, who became a duke and succeeded to the Tokugawa Keiki family; the tenth son, Sei, who became the adopted son-in-law of Katsu Kaishu; and the ninth daughter, Tsuneko, who became Queen Hiroyasu of Fushimi Palace.

His sons included Tokugawa Yoshimitsu and Princess Kikuko, who became the wife of Prince Norihito of Takamatsu.

Nara Line is a railroad line (trunk line) of West Japan Railway Company (JR West Japan) that runs from Kizu Station (Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture) to Kyoto Station (Shimogyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture).

All lines are included in the metropolitan-suburban segment.

Because of its history as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line, the official starting point is Kizu Station, but trains heading from Kyoto to Kizu are down (odd numbers) and up (even numbers) the other way.

Unless otherwise noted, except for the following route data, the description is from Kyoto to Kizu in the downhill direction.

The line color is brown (■), and the reason for its selection was "a classic, relaxed image linking two ancient capitals.

Jurisdiction (Type of Business): West Japan Passenger Railways (Railway Business Operator)

Distance (operating kilometer): 34.7 km Distance (operating kilometer): 34.7 km

Gauge : 1067mm

Number of stations: 19 (including origin and terminus stations)

Double track section: Shinden - Uji, JR Fujimori - Kyoto

Electrification section: All lines electrified (1500 V DC)

Blockage (railroad): Automatic blockage (double track section), single track Automatic blockage (single track section)

Security Device: Automatic Train Stop

Operating Center: Shin-Osaka Sogo Center

Maximum speed: 110 km/h (double track), 95 km/h (single track)

(Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of Nishi-Nippon Passenger Railway Co.

The line is named the Nara Line between Kyoto and Kizu, but the entire section is located in Kyoto Prefecture, and there is no line at all in Nara Prefecture.

This is due to the fact that the Kyoto-Nara section was originally constructed by Nara Railways, but was merged with Kansai Railways and then separated south of Kizu as part of the Osaka-Nagoya route.

However, the train enters the Kansai Main Line (Yamato Line) from Kizu Station and runs to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture.

JR West Japan designated the names of the Urban Network lines (JR Kyoto Line, JR Kobe Line, etc.) in the March 13, 1988 revision, but the Nara Line was not included in the revision.

The Kinki Nippon Railway Company also has the Kintetsu Nara Line, so the line is sometimes referred to as the "JR Nara Line.

In the days of the Japanese National Railways (JNR), the line was referred to as the "KOKUTETSU Nara Line," and the English name "JNR" was used on the signboards.

The Kintetsu Nara Line is opposed to the Yamato Line between Namba and Nara, and the JR Nara Line is opposed to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line.

In contrast to the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, where many trains used to operate, the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984, at the end of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) era, and even after electrification, it was a small local line with only a few 2-car JNR 105 series trains running for a while until the JNR was privatized.

However, after JR West incorporated the line into its urban network after its establishment, transportation has rapidly improved, with the addition of four-car trains (six-car trains in some cases), partial double track, and more rapid trains such as the "Miyakoji Rapid" and other rapid trains.

Today, the route is used for sightseeing at Heijo-in Temple in Uji City, and for commuting to work and school from Joyo City and other areas in southern Kyoto Prefecture.

However, the line is largely diverted to the east between Momoyama and Shinden, and runs outside the town center south of Joyo, so there is still a gap with the parallel Kintetsu Kyoto Line in terms of both inter-Kyoto and regional transport.

The trains are used by the Osaka Branch's Nara Railway District, but station facilities are managed by the Kyoto Branch with the exception of Kizu Station.

All stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA of Tokai Railway Company (JR Tokai), and PiTaPa of Slutto KANSAI.

South of Joyo Station, unmanned stations are also mixed in, so the ticket gates are simple.

Since 1984, when the express train "Kuroshio" (train) connecting Kyoto to Wakayama Station via Nara Line, Sakurai Line, and Wakayama Line was discontinued, only local trains were operated until 1991 (like limited express trains, special express trains were operated for a limited time). There are four types of trains in operation: rapid trains, express trains, trains by section, and local trains.

This is the fastest type of train on the Nara Line and is operated mainly during the daytime.

The train basically operates every 30 minutes, connecting with a local train at Uji Station.

The name of the "Miyakoji Rapid" was chosen from among the general public before the start of service.

As a train connecting the tourist destinations of Kyoto and Nara, it is used not only by Japanese but also by many foreign tourists.

All trains will be JR West 221 series trains, either 4-car or 6-car trains.

On double track sections, the maximum speed is 110 km/h, and 95 km/h on other sections.

The standard journey time from Kyoto to Nara is about 44 minutes, and from Nara to Kyoto about 47 minutes.

The train to Kyoto stops at Kamikoma Station or Tanagura Station for about 2 minutes on the way to Kyoto, and the time required for going up and down is slightly different because it is different from the Miyakoji Rapid train bound for Nara.

During New Year's Day, the train stops temporarily at Inari Station to accommodate visitors to Fushimi Inari.

evolution of sth. over time

March 3, 2001 (Heisei 13) - Start of operation.

March 15, 2003 - The train will stop at Tofukuji and Tamamizu Stations due to the revised timetable.

The train runs during morning and evening rush hours.

The "Miyakoji Rapid" also stops at JR Kokura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture).

All trains will be operated by the 221 series, either 4-car or 6-car trains.

The train basically operates every 30 minutes, connecting with a local train at Uji Station.

Like the Miyakoji Rapid mentioned above, it passes through Hiragoyama Station, where the Yamato Route Rapid stops.

Until March 2001, when the "Miyakoji Rapid" appeared, it stopped at Kyoto, Uji, Joyo (initially passing through), Kizu, and Nara, and used the JNR 117 series trains, which have not been used on the Nara Line since then.

In the morning and evening, some trains directly connect to the Yamato Line due to operational reasons.

The buses are operated mainly in the morning and at night.

Testified against sexual and power harassment at Dentsu

A 71-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of worsening pain in the left inguinal region.

An incisional biopsy was performed based on the preoperative diagnosis of malignant lymphoma.

Histopathologic findings included malignant peripheral schwannoma (MPNST), PENT, and synovial sarcoma as differential diagnoses.

Surface marker analysis strongly suggested NK/T cell lymphoma.

After further searching for the fusion gene, the patient was finally diagnosed with synovial sarcoma.

Immunohistochemical assistance is useful in the differential diagnosis of MPNST, PENT, and synovial sarcoma.

A 52-year-old woman with a chief complaint of difficulty in evacuation and back pain was diagnosed as having advanced stage esophageal cancer based on the results of a chest CT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Morphine suppositories were started for the pain, and concurrent radiation chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil was administered.

After the pain increased, he switched to fentanyl patches and continuous morphine hydrochloride subcutaneous injections to enhance his treatment of his pain.

Delirium appeared as mild symptoms, but not as severe disturbance, and could be treated with regular administration of chlorpromazine hydrochloride and a small additional dose of flunitrazepam on an ad hoc basis.

Drugs used for pain treatment and sleep stabilization were thought to be the cause of delirium, but as a result of intensified treatment for delirium, complaints of pain decreased and a good quality of life could be maintained.

He looked at the history of research into the etiology of Parkinson's disease.

He introduced findings related to mitochondrial damage and oxidative damage in Parkinson's disease, and discussed the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

He also looked at the onset of Parkinson's disease from a genetic point of view, and introduced the discovery of the causative gene for familial Parkinson's disease, Parkin, and findings related to its function, protein misfolding, and aggregation.

He also presented other current findings on the causative genes of familial Parkinson's disease, and mentioned future prospects for research on the etiology of Parkinson's disease.

First, I described the conventional understanding of the morphology and position of the lateral ligament of the rectum.

He stated that it is important to understand the lateral ligaments from the perspective of the entire physique.

The fascia was suggested to be an indicator of the components of the entire physique.

Next, he outlined the basic composition of the subperitoneal fascia and the characteristics of the pelvic fascia composition.

He also explained the characteristics of the rectum in the pelvis and the relationship between the rectum and fascia.

The causes of the problems that occurred when immunostaining was performed and their solutions were shown.

Examples of problems include: 1) target cells that stain even erythrocytes and cannot be identified, 2) different staining intensities, and 3) conspicuous staining of DAB.

One solution was the treatment of endogenous peroxidase.

The blocking method for endogenous peroxidase involves oxidation with 0.5 to 1% periiodic acid for 10 minutes, followed by oxidation with 0.5 to 1% periodic acid for 10 minutes. The blocking methods for endogenous peroxidase include oxidation with 0.5 to 1% periiodic acid for 10 min, oxidation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol at room temperature for 10 min, and oxidation with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol at room temperature for 10 min. There are three methods: oxidation with 0.5 to 1 % hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature, oxidation with 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min at room temperature, and oxidation with 3 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min at room temperature.

In case 2, the reaction box was tilted and the difference in antibody concentration between the left and right sides was considered to be the cause.

3 showed DAB coloration on the tissue and on the glass slide, which was thought to be caused by drying during the staining process.

Femoral fractures associated with stem loosening after hip or artificial head replacement surgery are one of the most serious complications.

Five patients with Vancouver type B2 and B3 fractures were treated.

The treatment methods were: one case of open repair and fixation using the Dall-Mailes system, one case of cement revision combined with impaction bone grafting, two cases of cement revision combined with two methods and a long stem, and one case of revision using a distal fixed cementless long stem. One case of revision using cemented bone grafting, two cases of cemented revision using two methods and a long stem, and one case of revision using a distal fixed cementless long stem.

Bone fusion was achieved in 4 patients at 3 months after surgery, and radiolucent line and migration were not observed.

The results suggest the need for revision surgery using a stem and a two-stage technique to stabilize the fracture and stem and to regain bone mass.

Keratitis caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and 2) is called keratitis herpetiformis.

The epithelial type is dendritic keratitis and map-like keratitis, the real type is discoid keratitis and necrotizing keratitis, and the endothelial type is corneal endothelial inflammation.

The pathophysiology of the disease, symptoms and findings, useful diagnostic tests and laboratory values, diagnostic criteria and definitive diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and explanation to patients were outlined.

Keratitis is caused not only by HSV but also by varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

He also outlined keratitis caused by VZV.

He outlined the drugs currently used and in development for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

He began by describing current therapies, including Levodopa, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, anticholinergics, and NMDA receptor blockers.

Next, he described the drugs currently under development, KW-6002, ONO-2506, and TCH-346, respectively.

Finally, he also discussed the future direction of development.

The physician's role is to explain the patient's condition and mental and physical changes to the family in an early and systematic manner.

The nurse's role is to assess and respond to the family's needs as early as possible.

The social worker's role is to conduct psychological and social assessments of the patient and family, identify family problems, and provide team support.

A case of a 50-year-old male was presented and explained.

He mentioned care for families after bereavement.

Using the Gabor transform, we developed a method to remove only the grid components from images taken using the scatter removal grid.

A Gabor transform is a type of window Fourier transform in which the Fourier transform is performed within a Gaussian window.

In this method, a Gabor function tuned according to the period of grid eyes is used as a filter function for grid eye extraction.

The chest image example shows that the Gabor conversion process produces less blur and less degradation of high-frequency components compared to the low-pass filter process for grid removal.

In a previous study of rabeprazole Na in reflux esophagitis, a dose of 20 mg was administered in the hope of maximizing efficacy.

In this study, we clinically examined the speed of disappearance of subjective symptoms with 10 mg rabeprazole Na, which is commonly used for reflux esophagitis, in a field clinic.

The subjects were 132 patients with heartburn and reflux esophagitis.

For heartburn of reflux esophagitis, administration of 10 mg rabeprazole Na showed significant subjective symptom improvement from 6 hours to early morning, and the effect lasted for 7 days, regardless of gender, age, and endoscopic severity of the disease.

Since the rate of complete resolution of heartburn also showed a rapid rise, rabeprazole Na 10 mg is a useful drug for the treatment of reflux esophagitis in clinical practice.

Fulminant myocarditis is a refractory disease in which about half of the patients die even after intensive treatment, and it is desirable to establish a treatment method that aggressively suppresses inflammation.

The authors conducted clinical and basic studies on the efficacy of immunoglobulin or its Fc portion (Ig) fusion protein against fulminant myocarditis.

Clinically, we analyzed the effects and characteristics of IVIg based on our experience with IVIg treatment of human fulminant myocarditis, and found no statistically significant difference in mortality with IVIg, but a trend toward lower mortality in the treated patients.

As a basic study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of Ig fusion proteins with various cytokines and immune-related genes on myocarditis using a rat model of autoimmune myocarditis.

The results showed that IL-13-Ig, CTLA4-Ig, IL-1 receptor antagonist-Ig, SLPI-Ig, and IL - 22 - Ig treatment was shown to be effective.

We clarified the relationship between the occurrence of hepatotoxicity, NAT2 gene polymorphism, and aging in Japanese pulmonary TB patients treated with isoniazid (INH)-containing antituberculosis drugs, and examined whether a dosing standard based on INH gene polymorphism that takes aging into consideration could be established.

There were 7 elderly TB patients (mean age 82.1 years) and 22 young TB patients (mean age 40.5 years). Seven elderly TB patients (mean age 82.1 years) and 22 young TB patients (mean age 40.1 years) were treated with INH. INH was administered to 7 elderly TB patients (mean age 82.1 years) and 22 young TB patients (mean age 40.1 years), and INH and its metabolite (N-acetyl isoniazid) concentrations in blood and urine were measured.

NAT 2 gene polymorphism was determined by the Invader method.

The Rapid acetylator did not cause liver damage in either the elderly or young patient groups.

In the intermediate acetylator, 1 in 3 elderly patients and 1 in 7 young patients developed liver damage.

The AUC of INH in patients with hepatotoxicity tended to be higher in the elderly patients than in the young patients.

Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is predicted to streamline and increase the efficiency of pharmacotherapy in the elderly.

In the geriatric care (aged 70 and over), we analyzed medical and pharmaceutical costs for each disease category.

Medical and pharmaceutical costs were estimated for each of the 119 categories of injuries and illnesses, based on the 2002 "Patient Survey" and "Survey of Social Medical Treatment Practices" published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and classified into geriatric care (age 70 and over).

When general medical care is included, the most expensive disease is hypertensive disease, but looking at geriatric medical care alone, the medical cost for hypertensive disease is 753.1 billion yen, which is lower than the 970 billion yen for cerebral infarction.

Infarction, high blood pressure disease, renal insufficiency, fracture and続く.

Looking at the medication and injection costs and their ratio to medical care costs in geriatric care, hypertension accounted for the highest amount of medication and injection costs among 119 diseases, and accounted for approximately 30% of medical care costs, which is relatively large.

He presented the progression of nutritional management from intravenous nutrition (PN) to central venous nutrition (TPN).

Enteral nutrition (EN) was reevaluated due to TPN complications.

The indications and routes of administration of intravenous and enteral nutrition were described.

The energy requirement of the Japanese is 25 to 35 kcal/kg.

He outlined the practicalities and caveats of EN and PN.

Finally, complications and their countermeasures were discussed.

We analyzed 231 cases that were spontaneously reported to the Medical Information Department of the Central Blood Center of the Japanese Red Cross Society as post-transfusion infections by medical institutions nationwide between January 2004 and December 2004, cases for which retrospective investigations were completed during 2004, and all cases investigated as experimental transfusion cases.

Transfusion transmission of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV has decreased significantly since the introduction of the minipool nucleic acid amplification test.

However, the number of cases spontaneously reported by medical institutions nationwide remains high, indicating the need to clarify the causal relationship between blood transfusion and infection.

In June 2003, we started a retrospective study including past positive cases.

Research and development of a new cancer diagnostic imaging technology for accurate and efficient diagnosis of cancer of the trunk using multimodal imaging of the trunk was conducted.

A large scale imaging database was established through strong collaboration between medical and engineering personnel, and computer-assisted imaging and diagnostic techniques were established by utilizing the large scale database.

Quantitative analysis of morphological and functional image characteristics of cancer lesions in the trunk was conducted using 3D multi-modal images of the trunk, and an algorithm for trunk cancer detection and diagnosis was developed based on the quantitative basis of the analysis results using large-scale image data.

By conducting clinical evaluation of the developed algorithm and improving its performance, we expect to commercialize a new cancer diagnostic imaging system for imaging and diagnosis of trunk cancer.

10.4% of outpatients in a remote mountainous area complained of knee pain, of which 17% had osteoarthritis of the knee. Of these, osteoarthritis accounted for 17%.

Osteoarthritis of the knee is caused by an increase in body weight or a history of lifting weights, and if the condition progresses, the patient may develop an internal recoil knee (O-leg).

The lecture explained the diagnosis, examination procedures, and treatment, including symptoms, physical examination findings, arthrofacial fluid testing, and radiographs.

Treatment and patient education for osteoarthritis of the knee, including weight reduction, use of canes, quadriceps training, extrapolation plates, supporters, anti-inflammatory analgesics, glucosamine and chondroitin, knee joint puncture and injections, were discussed.

As surgical treatment, he explained about high tibial osteotomy and artificial knee joint replacement.

He described when to refer the patient to a specialist, how to consult a specialist, and advice from a specialist.

First, he described the purpose of the clinical path, its use for informed consent, and the creation of pamphlets.

Next, he outlined the thoracoscopic-assisted esophagectomy, reconstructive surgery, preoperative management, and postoperative management.

Next, he explained the cases that are not eligible for the clinical pathway.

In addition, he explained the outline of the clinical path for esophageal cancer surgery and how to respond to variances.

He described the explanation to patients and their families when a variance occurs, as well as the issues involved.

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need to address chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the importance of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation formulas has been recognized.

All patients with GFR less than 60 ml/min-1-1.73 m-2 are defined as having chronic kidney disease. It has been proposed to define all patients with GFR less than 60 ml/min-1-1.73 m-2 as having chronic kidney disease, and to establish treatment guidelines by classifying CKD patients according to their GFR.

A common global GFR estimation formula is expected to address the need for a global approach to CKD and to ensure that effective CKD countermeasures can be shared worldwide.

International developments in GFR estimation formulas were summarized.

We analyzed the effects of ongoing nutritional intervention on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on the compliance and effectiveness of nutritional guidance.

In order to provide more detailed nutritional intervention, the nutritional status of patients with dementia was classified according to total energy intake, and for the group with excess total energy, a 75 g glucose loading test was conducted, and abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism were classified.

Nutritional intervention consisted of correcting eating behavior and excessive sugar intake according to the characteristics of the nutritional status.

They were instructed to eat at least one serving of fish, two servings of green and yellow vegetables, and one serving of vitamin C-rich fruits each day.

Using the phenomenon that the subjectively perceived intensity of a stimulus is attenuated by the application of another stimulus immediately before it (PPI-PPSI), we developed a direct measurement method of perceptual information control based on "Perceived Stimulus Intensity Judgment" and compared PPI-PPSI between healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. - We compared PPI and PSI between healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients.

A significant positive correlation was found between the stimulus intensity and VAS score in the target group, indicating the validity of converting the stimulus intensity by the VAS score.

The patient group showed significantly lower suppression of perceived stimulus intensity by prepulse presentation than the subject group, indicating a PPI-PPSI impairment.

The PPI - PSI deficits observed in schizophrenia may reflect impairments in the ability to control and integrate sensory input.

Until recently, morphine was the only opioid available for moderate to severe cancer pain, but the availability of fentanyl paste and oxycodone extended-release tablets has greatly expanded the range of treatment options.

Oxycodone was synthesized as a semi-synthetic derivative of thebaine.

Oxycodone has a relatively high affinity for μ-receptors and is thought to exert its analgesic effects via μ-receptors, but the point of action has not been fully elucidated.

Because there is no effective limit, doses can be increased until pain is eliminated.

Effective for cancer pain caused by neuropathic pain or with coexisting neuropathic pain.

Adverse effects such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting are similar to or less severe than those of morphine and are considered adjustable.

Sixty-three patients who underwent standby coronary artery angioplasty were divided into a fenofibrate-treated group and a control group. CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) activity and lipoprotein fractionation by HPLC were measured before and 6 months after administration of the drug.

In the fenofibrate-treated group, a significant decrease in TG and increase in HDL-C were observed, and an increase in LDL particle diameter with a significant decrease in the small LDL fraction and a decrease in HDL particle diameter with a significant increase in the small HDL fraction were observed.

Furthermore, a decrease in CETP activity was observed, and a negative correlation was observed between the decrease in CETP activity and the change in LDL particle size.

Fenofibrate may induce changes in lipoprotein fraction via inhibition of CETP activity.

We studied periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in 48 children with low birth weight.

The subjects were 43 normal children and 5 PVL children.

As a result, cerebral blood volume in the right internal carotid artery was significantly lower in PVL cases than in normal cases at ages 0, 2, 63, and 91.

Cerebral blood volume in the left internal carotid artery was significantly lower in PVL cases than in normal cases at ages 0, 2, 4, 21, 28, 35, 56, 63, 84, and 91.

In conclusion, it is possible that the volume of blood entering the brain is reduced after birth in children who are considered clinically leukodystrophic.

We analyzed past data on the current status of our dizygotic blood bank (I) and conducted a questionnaire survey of women who delivered in term labor.

The collection method was also shown.

Of the 698 total deliveries, 281 were I-registered and 182 met the criteria for adoption.

The questionnaire was administered to 77 respondents, 39 of whom responded validly, and 13 of whom answered "yes" to the question about cooperation with I. The number of respondents who responded "yes" to the question about cooperation with I was 1.5 times the number of those who responded "no" to the question about cooperation with I.

Reasons for not meeting the conditions for I included preterm labor, miscarriage, and water breaking during the first trimester.

The number of I sampling increased, and the reason was that we devised the information method, for example, we only distributed pamphlets at outpatient clinics, and confirmed the requests when the patient came to the hospital for delivery.

We administered branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) granule formulations to patients with cirrhosis for 12 months and investigated the changes in amino acid metabolism, mainly glutamic acid.

After 1 year of treatment with BCAA granule formulation, BUN level and Fisher ratio increased significantly, and PT activity tended to increase.

Glutamate, BCAA, alanine, and aspartate levels increased significantly, while asparagine and glutamine levels tended to increase and cystine levels tended to decrease.

The amino acids considered to be the main contributors to nitrogen loading were AAA (phenylalanine + tyrosine), asparagine, aspartate, and cystine.

When BCAA granules were administered, dietary guidance centered on a protein restriction of 12 g of the amino acids contained in the granule formulation was considered necessary.

Egg tofu containing 3 g of lactosucrose (lactosucrose) per serving was developed, and healthy female students consumed one serving per day for two weeks to investigate the effects on bowel movements.

The number of defecation days, frequency of defecation, and amount of defecation increased during the period when the test diet was ingested.

No significant changes were observed in stool characteristics, color, odor, hardness, sensation after defecation, occurrence of abdominal symptoms, fecal pH, ammonia content, or water content.

A significant increase in the prevalence of Bifidobacterium in the fecal microbiota was observed during the intake period of the test meal.

In a safety study in which 3 test foods were ingested per day for 4 weeks, the effects on hematology, hematochemistry, urinalysis, and abdominal symptoms were examined, and no clinically problematic changes were observed.

The test food was effective in improving the defecation situation and was safe.

We report a case of non-clostridial gas gangrene in a 72-year-old man.

Based on clinical findings, radiographic examination, and MRI, the disease was diagnosed as gas gangrene.

The company enforced de Breedemann.

Peptostreptococcus sp. Peptostreptococcus sp. , Prevotella sp. , Bacteroides sp. and Corynebacterium sp. and Corynebacterium sp. were detected.

After the surgery, the patient underwent a skin grafting operation.

Case ： 29 years old, female, hospitalized for suspected acute meningitis during the course of primary Sjoegren's syndrome (SS).

After immunoserology and CSF examination, he was diagnosed as having aseptic meningitis associated with SS, and rapidly improved on dexamethasone administration.

However, it was repeated twice.

In addition, serum anti-SS-B antibody levels, serum IGg levels, and CSF anti-SS-A antibody levels were all elevated compared to when meningitis did not occur.

This case of repeated aseptic meningitis in the same patient was considered to be a valuable case that suggested an association between aseptic meningitis and SS activity.

The mechanism of appetite suppression of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluvoxamine (FL) was investigated.

In mice that had been fasted for 24 hours, administration of FL alone had no effect on feeding inhibition.

Administration of FL after preadministration of SB 242084 (SB), a selective serotonin 5-HT 2C receptor antagonist, had an inhibitory effect on feeding, suggesting that it was mediated by the MC4 and MC3 receptors.

Inhibition of FL feeding by SB pretreatment was accompanied by activation of POMC neurons in the hypothalamus.

The peripheral mechanism of the feeding suppression effect of FL was suggested to be related to the reduction of active ghrelin concentration in blood.

Expression of the SGK-1 gene was strongly increased in the SB + FL group.

The efficacy of oyster extract added to a Chinese herbal extract formulation was investigated.

We presented a case of acute exacerbation of late menopause (a 69-year-old woman), a case of impulse buying associated with manic-depressive illness (a 67-year-old woman), and a case of functional gastroenteritis (a 50-year-old woman) whose symptoms were improved by the addition of oyster mushrooms.

In this study, it was found that oyster mushrooms are expected to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate neuropsychiatric symptoms when the sedative and anesthetic effects of the primary pharmacotherapy are inadequate.

Oyster mushrooms also improved apathy and depression.

He discussed the relationship between paranasal inflammation and headache.

An autopsy case of paranasal inflammation with symptoms that met the diagnostic criteria for primary headache was presented.

A case of migraine (17-year-old female), tension-type headache (55-year-old male), and cluster headache (26-year-old male) were presented.

In addition, the relationship between paranasal inflammation and headache and the findings of headache caused by paranasal inflammation are presented.

We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (74-year-old woman) that had to be differentiated from localized nodular hyperplasia.

Imaging revealed central scars and clear axle-like vascular structures, suggesting hepatocellular carcinoma or localized nodular hyperplasia (FNH).

Percutaneous needle biopsy was negative for FNH, and a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made and a posthepatic resection was performed.

The histopathological diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma mainly of medium differentiated type.

The patient was a 10-year-old boy at the time of initial examination.

After removal of the tumor in the fourth ventricle, the tumor attached to the medulla oblongata was inoperable.

The patient underwent multidisciplinary treatment, including autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and was doing well, but later developed disseminated relapse.

After chemotherapy failed to improve this resistant cerebelloblastoma patient, activated autologous lymphocyte transfusion (ALT) was administered, and the tumor disappeared.

However, after 1 year and 7 months, a mass recurrence was observed, and periodic intravenous vinblastine, three-way intramuscular injection (methotrexate, cytarabine, hydrocortisone), and ALT were administered, and stereotactic irradiation was added.

ALT alone caused recurrence of myeloblastoma, but when used in combination with other therapies, it had an antitumor effect and was effective in improving QOL.

The paper describes the significance of calculation, conditions for calculation, and characteristics of existing indices, and provides discussion and recommendations on the ideal health and longevity indices in Japan.

Healthy life expectancy is broadly classified into DALE and DFLE, depending on how the semi-healthy portion B is discounted.

DALE divides the B portion (actually A + B) by a weight of 0 - 1, which requires weighting for health and disability.

DFLE divides part B (actually A + B) into two parts, 0 and 1, and requires a definition of health.

Although the DFLE is often preferred because of its ease of calculation, it cannot be used alone as a comprehensive indicator, and it is considered necessary to calculate it separately for multiple health domains when used.

We report a case of Darier's disease in a 26-year-old male.

The patient's chief complaint was a generalized skin rash.

Based on clinical and histopathological findings, the disease was diagnosed as Darier's disease.

Candida albicans was detected in the lesion.

Symptoms did not improve with antibiotics or etretinate.

Reduction of etretinate and oral administration of itraconazole prevented exacerbation of symptoms.

The following is a selection of topics from the reports on vision, refraction, and tonometry.

With regard to vision, he presented a detailed report on the characteristics of sweep VEP.

He also introduced a study that investigated the effect of eye optics on contrast sensitivity.

In refraction, he presented reports on refractive surgery and wavefront aberration, IOL and wavefront aberration, accommodative IOL, frequency and epidemiology of refractive error, and treatment of complications of pathologic myopia.

In addition, he introduced research on the mechanism of myopia in experimental myopia, the genetics and genetic analysis of pathological myopia, and reports on the treatment of myopia.

In the area of adjustment, he presented reports on adjustment by vertical chromatic aberration, other sensory measures of adjustment, and adjustment and aging.

Liver abscess is the general term for a condition in which the pathogen enters the liver tissue from outside the liver, resulting in tissue destruction, necrosis, and pus accumulation in the liver.

The basic treatment strategy is to administer optimal antibacterial agents and puncture and aspirate the abscess.

Surgical resection or open drainage may be necessary in cases of generalized peritonitis due to rupture of an abscess or in cases of poor drainage.

He outlined the pathogenesis of liver abscess (bacterial abscess, amoebic liver abscess), symptoms, diagnostic imaging, and treatment (antimicrobial administration, puncture of abscess, drainage, and surgical procedures).

We investigated postoperative complications of skin valves in 20 patients with oral cancer who underwent primary reconstructive surgery using cervical isthmus valves.

Pathological findings in 20 cases were squamous cell carcinoma (18 cases), adenosquamous carcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (1 case).

The tumor sites were tongue in 12 cases, floor of mouth in 5 cases, and mandibular gingiva in 3 cases.

Necrosis of the skin valve was a postoperative complication in 5 patients, but no reoperation was necessary.

The cervical isthmus valve is minimally invasive and causes very little functional impairment, making it useful for elderly patients with moderate substantial defects and patients with oral cancer complicated by systemic disease.

The Mahaim bundle is a special accessory conduction pathway that connects the atria or ventricles to the stimulation conduction system, and has the same attenuation conduction characteristics as the atrioventricular node.

We report a case of a 43-year-old man with three types of tachycardia: two types of AVRT (AVRT) and normal AV nodal return tachycardia caused by a Mahayim bundle.

This case is a bundle of Mahayim's bundles connecting the atria to the right pedicle, with the atrial end located in the free wall of the tricuspid valve.

The ECG was normal without delta wave, but the QRS became wide with prolongation of P-QRS depending on atrial stimulation frequency, and left leg block type delta wave became apparent.

A slightly dull M potential was recorded at the posterior wall of the tricuspid valve, and the Mahaim bundle was successfully disconnected by energizing the same area.

The method of pacing multiple locations in the tricuspid valve area, examining the location with the shortest QRS rise from stimulation, and finding the M potential by detailed mapping in the vicinity can shorten the procedure time for the entire process from determination of the Mahaim bundle to ablation.

Two schizophrenic patients (a 33-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man) who had been reported to suffer from polydipsia and polyuria since around April developed water intoxication during psychiatric treatment.

In the previous case, rhabdomyolysis occurred due to water intoxication.

Clinically, both cases were considered to be within the category of psychogenic polydipsia.

The authors showed that the possible causes of rhabdomyolysis from water intoxication include electrolyte abnormalities and the effects of antipsychotic medications.

We investigated the relationship between the time of appearance of abnormal images of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (I) on MRI, the pattern of the initial images, and the radiological deformity of the femoral head.

As a result, abnormalities were detected in 12 patients at an average of 4.5 months after transplantation. The results showed that anomalies were detected in 12 patients at an average of 4.5 months after transplantation.

The band image appeared as an initial change, and the area surrounded by the band image could be determined as the necrotic area.

The MR classification and radiological prognosis were in good agreement.

From the above, it was considered possible to predict I by MRI.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the causative genes of hereditary neurological diseases using positional cloning methods and to clarify the molecular mechanism of neuronal degeneration.

Specifically, we have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of a series of hereditary spinocerebellar degenerative diseases and adrenoleukodystrophy, a demyelinating disease of consanguineous recessive inheritance.

As a result, we found the genetic loci of two neurological diseases, Machado-Joseph disease and spinocerebellar degeneration with hypoalbuminemia, and the causative gene of dentate nucleus redshifted pallidocyte Lewis body atrophy.

The results strongly supported that the "putative ALD gene" isolated by Mandel et al. is the causative gene of adrenal leukodystrophy.

Contains articles published in Japan and abroad [1994. 3]. 1994. 3]

Reported the status of detection.

The subject was 602 cases of diarrhea.

As a result, the number of pathogen-positive cases was 106 for toxigenic E. coli, 74 for Salmonella, 45 for Pleziomonas, 17 for Shigella, 12 for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 7 for Vibrio nagrophytes.

Thailand, Indonesia, and India were the main destinations, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of inspections.

The physicochemical properties of the drugs were outlined.

This drug is a combination of the carbapenem antibiotic panipenem and the organic anion transport system inhibitor betamipron, which is intended to reduce nephrotoxicity.

The formulation and physicochemical properties of each formulation are listed, and the formulation design and stability of the target formulation are outlined.

This product is stable at room temperature and is a two-layer lyophilized formulation, so cross-reactivity between the two products is also inhibited.

We report a case of a 50-year-old woman with a chief complaint of paroxysmal burning sensation, and a Holter electrocardiogram that showed ventricular extrasystolic contractions.

Extra-period contraction and serial attacks improved after oral administration of 300 mg of mexiletine (I), but the focus changed to multisource, so the agent (II) was administered in combination with the drug.

II administration, and at the ninth month, the patient was able to discontinue I because the subjective symptoms improved markedly and the frequency of extra-periodic contractions decreased and the sequential attacks disappeared.

II considered that the arrhythmia was indirectly improved by harmonizing the whole body and mind.

As a result of the study of the patients with NUD, delayed gastric evacuation and psychological factors played a major role in the pathogenesis, and Hp infection was also considered to be involved in some cases.

Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection was progressive against gastric emptying.

The mental function tests showed neurological tendencies associated with the complications of depression and prolonged illness.

Gastrointestinal motility stimulants were effective in delayed gastric evacuation and in Hp-uninfected patients.

Rats were abdominally opened under anesthesia, pancreatic juice was collected from a suction catheter, and a catheter was inserted into the gastric body to administer enprostil (I).

After the experiment, the pancreatic fluid was collected every 30 minutes.

After the volume measurement, the protein and bicarbonate ion content of the pancreatic juice was removed, and the remainder was mixed with bile and returned to the duodenum during the next 30 minutes.

After 90 minutes of basal secretion, 1.0 μg/kg of I was administered intragastrically. After 90 minutes of basal secretion, 1.0 μg/kg of I was administered intragastrically, and the effects on exocrine secretion for the next 2 hours were examined.

The effect of 1.0 µg of I on the exocrine secretion was also examined. The effect of 1.0 µg of I on serum secretion at 1 hour after intravenous administration was also examined.

Forty adult patients with bronchial asthma were treated with pemirolast potassium 20 mg/day for 6 to 62 weeks (mean 26.1 weeks). The patients were treated with pemirolast potassium 20 mg/day for 6 to 62 weeks (mean 26.1 weeks).

The overall level of improvement was 47.4% improved or more after 8 weeks, and 73.4% somewhat improved or more after 8 weeks. The degree of improvement was 47.4% at 8 weeks, 73.7% somewhat improved or more, and 64.6% at 24 weeks. The percentages were 64.0% and 92.6% at 8 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. After 24 weeks, the percentages were 64.0%, 92.0%, and 92.0%, respectively. The overall improvement was 64.0% and 92.0% at 8 weeks, 73.7% and 73.7% at 24 weeks, respectively.

In the scoring evaluation, significant improvement was observed in each item after two weeks.

No side effects were observed.

This disease is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by hypergranulocytosis with juvenile leukemia and leukemia, and accounts for about 15% to 20% of all leukemias.

The diagnosis is confirmed by a marked decrease in neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity or by the demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome by myelocyte chromosome analysis.

Chronic disease is divided into a chronic phase, which lasts several years, and an acute phase, in which an increase in blasts, called acute transformation, is observed.

Early detection is important.

The initial dose of cyclosporine was 3 mg/kg/day in 9 patients, and when improvement of the skin rash was observed after the initial dose, the skin rash improved by 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. The initial dose of cyclosporine was 3 mg/kg/day. The dose was reduced from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day over a 4-week period.

Six patients showed clinical response greater than or equal to efficacy to Clozapine administration.

When the number of CD-positive cells (I) in peripheral blood was calculated from the ratio of mononuclear cells to I, a slight increase was observed in 2 patients and a significant increase in 7 patients, mainly reflecting the increase in CD19-positive B cells.

The immunological mechanisms of xerosis were outlined and the significance of increased I was discussed.

The Japanese Guidelines for the Treatment of Asthma, published last year, indicate a new treatment regimen in which inhaled steroids are the mainstay of treatment for chronic asthma.

Antiallergic drugs that suppress allergic inflammation are effective in mild to moderate cases of atopic asthma and have few side effects.

It may be especially useful in cases with complications and in pediatric patients.

Theophylline extended-release bronchodilators are effective for nocturnal seizures when given once a day before bedtime.

The patient is a 34-year-old woman.

After childbirth at age 34, she suffered two vertebral fractures in succession.

The osteocalcin level at the time of the second fracture was lowered, and the bone mineral density test using the DPA method showed that L 20.833 g/cm2 , L 30.0 g/cm2 , L 30.0 g/cm2 , and L 30.0 g/cm2 . The bone mineral density by DPA method was found to be 20.833 g/cm2 and 30.882 g/cm2 , respectively. The DPA bone mineral density test showed that L 20.833 g/cm2 and L 30.882 g/cm2 were markedly lower than those of women of the same age group.

Lumbar spine radiographs showed progressive permeability and wedge-shaped deformity based on decreased bone mass.

Orthopedic treatment with orthotics and rehabilitation has resulted in improvement.

Partially deacetylated chitin (I) was tested for its application as a base material for transdermal formulations and for adjusting its retention properties.

Gel elasticity was measured by the instantaneous elastic modulus value, and gel retention was measured by the static elastic modulus/instantaneous elastic modulus value.

The concentrations were adjusted using a combination of 1-menthol and alcohol as a transdermal absorption enhancer and hydroxyacetic acid as a cross-linking agent.

In vitro evaluation of morphine as a model drug showed promising drug permeability.

The clinical efficacy of lansoprazole was investigated in 22 patients with recurrent gastrointestinal ulcers (14 gastric ulcers, 4 duodenal ulcers, 2 gastroduodenal ulcers, and 2 anastomotic ulcers) treated with 30 mg once daily for 6 to 8 weeks.

There were 13 cases of marked improvement and 9 cases of improvement.

Thirteen of the 17 patients who underwent endoscopy were judged to be cured.

One patient had an abnormal sense of taste.

Case of a 64-year-old woman.

She developed Parkinson's disease at the age of 44 and had been treated with L-dopa and trihexyphenidyl for 15 years by another doctor.

L-dopa was reduced and amantadine and bromocriptine were administered in combination with multiple medications.

In a case of worsening limp and psychiatric symptoms due to the progression of the disease, L-Dops was administered and both symptoms were improved.

Preoperative endometrial cytology using a uterobrush was performed in 5 cases of uterine body cancer (highly differentiated adenocarcinoma in 3 cases, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in 1 case, and adenohypophysis in 1 case), and positive results were obtained in all cases.

The localization of the tumor in the uterus was observed.

The histology and localization of the tumor were compared with the cellular picture.

We reviewed the literature comparing the three sample collection methods (endocyte method, suction tube method, and honed brush method), and considered the need to compare the endocyte method with the utero-brush method in a larger number of cases than in this report.

The characteristics of geriatric diseases were shown.

Although a drug history interview is necessary before treatment begins, the pharmacist should ideally be in charge of the drug history of patients undergoing initial treatment.

Drug behavior is different in the elderly than in adults.

He showed the factors that influence drug behavior, and pointed out that the pharmacist's active involvement in the geriatrician's knowledge of drug behavior assists the clinician's prescribing.

The occurrence of side effects characteristic of geriatrics and the interactions of multiple drugs should be discussed jointly by pharmacists and physicians.

A clinical study of single and continuous administration of alendronate injection was conducted in patients with hypercalcemia associated with malignant tumors.

In addition, the therapeutic effect on hypercalcemia, blood concentration, and urinary excretion of Clozapine were also examined.

In both single and continuous studies, both adverse effects and abnormal changes in laboratory values were minor and dose dependence was not observed.

Drug pharmacokinetics were examined. Clozapine was rapidly eliminated from the blood stream, and 18 to 33% of the dose was excreted into the urine by day 3 after a single dose.

The purpose and outline of corner angle adhesion dissection surgery were described.

He added that the indication was angle closure glaucoma with peripheral pre-iris adhesion in more than one half of the corner angle.

The necessary surgical instruments, such as the corner prism, adhesion dissection needle, and anterior chamber cleaning needle, were explained.

The important surgical positions of the head are described, and corneal puncture, dissection of adhesions, anterior chamber washing, and laser corner angioplasty are discussed.

We discussed terminal care through a case of a liver cancer patient (male, 46 years old).

During the second week of hospitalization, the patient, his children, foster father, and relatives were informed of the cancer.

The patient's condition gradually worsened during the third month of hospitalization, and the patient died.

This case made me think about what it means to be a family and what it means to live.

In order to be involved in the announcement process, you need to have a wide range of experiences as a human being.

We will continue to enhance conferences to promote consensus.

We studied 11 patients who had been hospitalized for neurosurgical diseases and had been receiving home nursing and home care by family members for 3 months to 5 years because of persistent impairments in consciousness.

Spouses were the most common caregivers.

Patients who had a family cooperative system were free from scurvy, but those who did not have such a system had severe scurvy.
