Later, when the Sakara group became a faction, there were two schools of OHARA's statements.

Later, Soukai revived the Ohara-voice.

Zanzi established a new flow based on a new musical theory.

Since then, it has been the core of the Tendai Ovidian and has been continued in the current Tendai Ovidian.

The Yutsu-Nenbutsu sect, the Jodo sect, and the Jodo Shinshu sect are all descended from the Tendai lineage of the Tendai Ovyo.

The Shingon statement is based on what Kukai transmitted and has continued to the present day.

The statements have been systematized since Manga.

Kancho was one of the most prominent of all the great masters.

We worked on composing and developing the statement.

Until the Kamakura period (1185-1333), there were many schools, but under the reign of Prince Kakusei, they were divided into four schools (Hon-Soinin School, Shin-Soinin School, Daigo School, and Nakagawa Daishin School).

Kogi: The Shingon Sect's vocalizations declined and became obsolete during the Edo period (1603-1867).

The Hon-Soinin, Shin-Soinin, and Daigo schools were abolished by the mid-Meiji period (1868-1912).

Today, it is divided into Chizan (Chizan) Voice (Chizaki-in, Kyoto), Buzan (Buzan) Voice (Hase-ji, Nara), and Nanzan Shinryu (Nanzan Shinryu, Koyasan, Kyoto).

Shingi Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect, Shingon Sect. Both schools of the Toyoyama school of the Shingon sect have their origins in the Nakagawa Daishin school.

Yoriyu adopted the ancient Daigo school.

In 1583, when Negoroji Temple (Wakayama Prefecture) was burnt down by Hideyoshi Toyotomi and declined, the Chizan and Toyozan schools formed their own school based on the Daigo school.

It is characterized as a "discussion" of Toyozan and a "statement" of Chizan.

The Nanzan Shinryu (Kogi Shingon sect of voicing) was based on the Nakagawa Daishinryu.

Nakagawa Daishin-ryu was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa-ji Temple in Nara.

During the Jouei period (1232-1233), Katsushin of Sanboin in Rengeya, Koyasan, moved his headquarters to Koyasan.

Later, it was called Nanzan Shinryu, after Nanzan, another name for Koyasan (Mt. Koya).

Also called Shinryu and Noyama Shinryu.

Heikyoku, yokyoku, folk songs, joruri, and other forms of omokyoku can be said to be a transfiguration of the voiced form.

The influence on mono-syllabic music is significant.

Emperor Tenchi.

Male .

34th year of Emperor Pegu (626) - December 3, 10th year of Emperor Tenchi (January 7, 672)

38th Emperor.

His posthumous name is Amemi no Mikoto Hirakasunomikoto (Amemi no Mikoto Hirakasunomikoto / Amatsu no Mikoto Sakiakasunomikoto).

His real name was Katsuragi.

He is thought to have been called Katsuragi no Mikoko (Prince Katsuragi) in his lifetime.

He is generally known as Prince Naka-no-Ohji (Prince Naka-no-Ohno-miko).

The word "big brother" means "crown prince," and "middle brother" means "next crown prince.

general view

The second son of Emperor Shumei.

Her mother was the Princess Hou (later Emperor Kōkyoku).

The empress was the daughter of her half-brother, Prince Kohito Oono-Ohio, the Princess of Yamato.

He conspired with Nakatomi Kamatomo and others to stage a coup d'état, killing Soga Iruka and installing his uncle Emperor Kotoku on the throne, who himself became the crown prince.

He also instituted the name of the new emperor, Taika, and carried out various reforms (the Taika Reforms were centered on the Otomi Incident).

He also framed and executed those who might later stage a coup d'etat, such as Prince Arima.

After Baekje was destroyed by Tang and Silla in 660, Buyeo Pung-zhang, a Baekje prince who had been staying at the imperial court, was sent back to revive Baekje.

He stayed in Tsukushi to lead a relief mission to the Baekje, but Emperor Saimei collapsed (died) in 661.

In 663, after the great defeat at the Battle of Hakumura-jiang, he moved the capital to the city of Otsu and ascended the throne there.

After the Battle of Hakuchon, water castles, beacons, and defenders were established as part of the national land defense policy.

The crown also underwent a reform of the system, moving from the 19th to the 26th rank.

In 670, he had Japan's oldest nationwide family register, the Gengo Nengzhi, created.

According to the Nihon-shoki, Emperor Tenchi wanted his first son Otomo to succeed to the throne.

However, in the Jinshin Disturbance that occurred after Tenchi's death, his younger brother Prince Oumihito (Emperor Temmu) defeated Prince Otomo and ascended to the throne.

The following emperors in the Temmu lineage continued until Emperor Shoutoku.

After Shoutoku's death, Shirakabe, a grandson of Tenchi, ascended the throne as Emperor Kounin, and the lineage thereafter became the Tenchi line.

It is said that he sent four of his daughters to the Prince of the Ocean as his concubines as atonement for having stolen King Nukata from the Prince of the Ocean.

December 3, 10 Tenchi (January 7, 672) - Died at age 46

(In the Fuso Biographical Record, after the theory that he died of illness, there is a theory that he was assassinated by Emperor Temmu because he is said to have gone missing in the mountains (the text states "一云天皇駕馬幸 山階 鄕更無 還御永交 山林不知 崩所 只是是是是山陵 以往諸 皇不知因果 恒事害").

The fact that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for so long is one of the mysteries in the political history of the mid-7th century.

There are several theories that have been discussed.

Consideration for the forces promoting Emperor Temmu.

Emperor Temmu was the younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, which has been conventionally accepted as a theory, is incorrect, and is based on the theory that Emperor Kogoku was the son of Emperor Han before his marriage to Emperor Seimei, and that he was the half-brother of Emperor Tenchi.

Certainly, if we were to calculate the birth years of Emperor Tenchi in the Nihon Shoki (Nihon Shoki) and Emperor Temmu in some of the history books based on their ages of birth, then Emperor Temmu would be the older of the two.

However, there are no discrepancies between the same historical records, and most of them have an age difference of about 8 to 9 years.

In response to this, some claim that "although the fathers were different, the younger brother's age was deliberately raised because it would have been unpresentable for the elder brother to take precedence over the younger brother," but the age of 16 in the Nihon-shoki was the age of Emperor Seimei at the time of his accession, and was mistakenly given as the age at the time of his death. The age of 16 is shown in the Nihon-shoki (Chronicles of Japan).

Therefore, the true year of birth is 614, as recorded in the Honcho Imperial Records of Imperial Inheritance Shaoun and other records.

In fact, Tenchi and Motoi, who reigned before and after Temmu, did not immediately ascend to the throne because they were under the title of "Emperor of Japan".

The error was due to the fact that the

Some argue that the "Nihon Shoki" and the other historical books pointed out cannot be treated as the same because they were compiled in different periods and have different characteristics.

(See also "Age of Emperor Temmu")

The Otomi Incident was a coup d'etat by Prince Karu (Emperor Koutoku), and Prince Nakataio was ousted from his position.

In recent years, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Nakataio and Soga Irika was relatively good, and that their basic policies were similar.

This would give Prince Nakataio no motive for killing Irika.

The fact that the Taika Reform of the Nihonshoki was falsified in the account of the Taika Reform in the Nihonshoki also led to this theory.

This theory has also attracted attention because it can explain other questions, such as the reason for Emperor Kogoku's abdication and the reason why the Soga clan other than Irika was not ousted even after the coup.

The theory that the accession to the throne was delayed due to opposition to Tenchi's relations with women.

This is based on a poem written in the Nihon-shoki (Chronicles of Japan) in which Emperor Koutoku refers to his wife, Mazu-no-Hito (Tenchi's half-sister), as suggesting an adulterous relationship between her and Tenchi.

While love and marriage were permitted between half-siblings and sisters, love and marriage between half-siblings and sisters was not permitted, He was reprimanded by the furious Prince Arima.

It is said that after the death of Emperor Saimei, the Mamito Princess succeeded to the throne as the consort of the previous emperor, but that the record was erased for some reason.

This is based on the theory that "Chūō-no-Mikoto" in the Manyōshu is a Mānin-no-Kojo, and that "Chūō-no-Mikoto" can be interpreted as the emperor who succeeded to the throne before the ascension of Tenchi.

If the Princess Manin = "Chugu no Mikoto," it is possible to explain why she alone was called by this title, but there is no proof that she was the Emperor Saimei, as there are some who believe that she was the Emperor.

Although it is difficult to prove the existence of the site due to the nature of political history and the limitation of historical materials, we expect further progress in this research, including collaboration with archaeological findings.

歌

He is also known as one of the Manyo poets whose four poems are included in the Manyoshu (Anthology of Myriad Leaves).

The Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka also pays homage to the founder of the Heian dynasty, and the following poem is included at the beginning of the Ogura Anthology.

The autumn fields are covered with a mat of dried leaves, and my hands are wet with dew.

The following poem is also from the Manyoshu.

Kaguyama is a mountain where Aisagi and Ajisanari fight with each other since the time of the gods, and where even the clouds are struggling with each other.

The Saionji family was a noble family descended from the Fujiwara clan.

The Fujiwara family is of the Kanyin school of the Fujiwara Northern Household, the Seika family.

The Doin and Imadegawa (Kikutei) families are branches of the Saionji family.

Another prominent branch of the Saionji family is the Saionji clan of Iyo Province.

The family crest is a left three-patterned emblem.

The Saionji family was founded by Fujiwara Michinori, the third son of Fujiwara no Kimizane.

During the war, he was imprisoned by the court, but after the war, he gained the confidence of the shogunate and became the Kanto-Shinji, which meant that he had the power of the court, and rose to the position of Grand Minister of State, elevating him in the family.

The family name "Saion-ji" is derived from the name of the temple that Kokei built in his villa in Kyoto (Kitayama-so, Kuzuno-gun, Yamashiro Province).

The present Kinkakuji Temple was built by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, who received the land from the Saionji family.

With the support of the Kamakura shogunate, he became the dominant power throughout the Kamakura period.

Saionji Jiken became close to the Daikakuji government, and had daughters by the emperors Kameyama and Godaigo.

However, after his son Saionji Kimihira distanced himself from the Shogunate, he supported the Mochimyo-in government and deepened the conflict with the Daikakuji government.

Later, during the reign of Saionji Kimimune, the Kamakura shogunate fell and he was relieved of his role as Kanto Shinji.

Kimimune sheltered Hojo Yasuie (Tokioki), a remnant of the Hojo clan, and planned a plot to assassinate Emperor Godaigo, who had initiated the new Kenmu government, and to install Emperor Go-Fushimi of the Jōmyōin line.

During the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Saionji Jitsutoshi, a son of Kimimune, served the Northern Dynasty (Japan) and rose to the position of Minister of the Right, and the family name was rebuilt.

In the Muromachi and Edo periods, the family was known as a biwa (lute) family.

In the early Edo period, Saionji Sanetsuharu became the son of Hosokawa Tadaoki (later disinherited), Hosokawa Tadataka, and Nagaoka Yukimu's eldest daughter Tokuhime as his wife, and rose to the position of Left Minister. Nagaoka Yukimu provided the Saionji family with various financial support and also donated 600 ishi of his estate (Watakoh Sairiku).

He was adopted by Saionji Kimochi from the Tokudaiji family of the Kanoin school, and became active as a politician after the Meiji Restoration, serving as Minister of the Prime Minister of the Cabinet and as a senior official in political circles during the Taisho and Showa periods.

It is said that Prince Koizumi was not good at playing the biwa, which should have been the family business of the Saionji family, but while he was Prime Minister, the Meiji Emperor played a prank and told him that he wanted to hear the Saionji family's biwa for the first time in a long time, and he had a hard time playing the biwa with the staff of the Imperial Household Ministry's Gagaku Dormitory.

Hieizan (Mt. Hiei) is a mountain located in the western part of Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture and the northeastern part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.

It is the general name of a bimodal peak consisting of O-Hiei (848.3 m) located on the border between Otsu City and Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, and Shimeigake (838 m) in Sakyo Ward. It is the general name of a bimodal peak consisting of two peaks, O-Hiei (848.3 m) and Shimeigake (838 m), both located in Sakyo-ku, Kyoto City.

The first triangle of Ohiei is located in Otsu City.

Along with Koyasan, it has long been considered a mountain of faith and prospered as the site of Enryakuji Temple and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine.

Included in Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).

Other names include Eizan, Hokurei, Tendaisan, and Miyako Fuji.

summary

Because of its location to the northeast of Kyoto, which is the "demon gate" of Kyoto, Hieizan was regarded as a mountain for the protection of the royal castle.

In the Kojiki, Mt. Hiei is described as Hie-no-Yama (Mt. Hie), and it is written that the deity Oyama Kakui was enshrined on Mt. Hie in Omi Province, with Narutabura as its deity.

After Enryakuji Temple opened on Mt. Hie, Oyama Kakui-jin was regarded as the guardian deity of the Tendai sect and Enryakuji Temple, and belief in Sanno as the deity Oyama Kakui-jin spread.

Hieizan is also a mountain of faith, where the 1,000-day pilgrimage to Enryakuji Temple is held to worship at the various halls on the summit of Mt.

Mountain climbing is also popular, with typical trailheads including Unmo-zaka from Shugakuin in Kyoto City's Sakyo Ward and the Mudoji Valley trail from Sakamoto (Otsu City) in Shiga Prefecture's Monzenmachi.

The Unmo-zaka slope has long been a route taken by monks, priests, and imperial messengers from the Imperial Court who traveled between Kyoto and Enryaku-ji Temple, and is still frequented by climbers today.

The Tokai Nature Trail runs through the mountain from Otsu to Ohara, Kyoto.

The toll road, cable car, and ropeway to the top of the mountain attract many tourists on weekends and holidays.

The former Hieizan summit amusement park and Hieizan man-made ski resort were all closed by 2002. The former ski resort is now a cosmos park, and the former summit amusement park is now the Garden Museum Hiei.

There was also a yuenchi (forest preserve) in Yase at the foot of the Kyoto side, but it was closed on November 30, 2001, and a members-only resort hotel was built on the site.

Da Hiei and Shimei Takeshi

According to the GSI, the eastern peak is called "O-Hiei" and the western peak is called "Shimeidake" or "Hieizan" in general.

In the "Chronicle of Points," the name of the first triangle on the eastern peak is given as "Mount Hiei.

This triangle point is located on the border between Otsu City and Kyoto City, but its location is in Otsu City.

Hieizan from the Kyoto Basin, it is difficult to identify the summit of the Great Hiei, and it is often assumed that Shimei-dake is the summit of Hieizan.

The Keifuku Electric Railway Eizan Ropeway designates the summit of Mount Shimei as the Hieizan summit station.

There are many theories on how to write or read Shimeigatake, including "Shimeigatake (四明が岳, Shimei-dake)" by the Geographical Survey Institute, and "Shimeigatake (四明ヶ岳)" and "Shimei-mine (四明峰)" by the Kyoto Municipal Government in "Place Names in Kyoto City.

Hieizan, as well as Mt. Tiantai and Mt. Shimei, are derived from Mt. Tiantai and Mt. Shimei in the People's Republic of China, which are sacred mountains associated with the Tiantai sect of Buddhism.

Fifty-three Stages of the Tokaido

The 53 stops on the Tokaido Highway connecting Edo (Nihonbashi (Chuo-ku, Tokyo)) and Kyoto (Sanjo Ohashi) in the Edo period (1603-1867).

This is explained in this section.

The 53 Stages of Tokaido are the 53 stops on the Tokaido Highway, one of the seven main roads of the Ginki region established during the Edo period (1603-1868).

Each of the 53 inns was located in a scenic spot or at a famous historic site, and was often the subject of ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints), waka poems, and haiku.

The term 53rd is used to refer to the route to Kyoto, while the 57th is used to refer to the route to Osaka.

According to one theory, Tokugawa Ieyasu chose 53 as the stations from Edo (the land of the defiled) to Kyoto (where Fugen Bosatsu resides), based on a passage in the "Iruhokaikaishin" of the Kegonkyō, which states that Zenzai-dozhi attained enlightenment in the presence of Fugen Bosatsu through 53 teachers under the orders of Monju Bosatsu.

The Kyoto Street (Osaka Street), an extension of the Tokaido Highway, was established in 1619.

The 57 Stages of the Tokaido Highway is sometimes referred to as the 57 Stages of the Tokaido Highway, including the inns on the Kyoto Street.

When entering the Kyoto Street from the Tokaido Highway, one does not pass through the Sanjo Ohashi Bridge, but instead turns southwest at Bearded Tea House Oiwake (Oiwake-cho, Otsu City) (Otsu Street), so the next stop after Otsu-juku is Fushimi.

Makura-no-soshi" ("The Pillow Book") is an essay said to have been written by Sei Shonagon, a female writer in the middle of the Heian period (794-1185).

The earliest known manuscript from the Kamakura period (1185-1333), Maeda-bon, has a makie lacquer-work box inscribed "Sei Shonagon Pillow Book".

The "Sei Shonagon Ki" is a collection of writings by the author of the "Sei Shonagon Ki" and others.

The "Tale of Genji" is the twin masterpieces of second-hand literature, and had a great influence on the renga, haikai, and kana-zoshi of later generations.

Along with Kamo Chōmei's Hōjōshi and Yoshida Kenko's Kakurezuregusa, it is considered one of Japan's three greatest works of history and satire.

It is extremely unique in style, and while it bears some resemblance to the Yishan miscellany compiled by the late Tang Dynasty poet Li Shangyin (literally, Yishan), there are no other similar works to be found.

According to the postscript at the end of the book, the motive for writing the book and the origin of its name are attributed to the fact that when Fujiwara no Ishu, the Inner Minister, presented his sister Fujiwara no Sadako and Emperor Ichijo with some expensive paper, Sei Shonagon was asked by the emperor, "The emperor has already copied the Shiki, but what about this one?

The paper was given to him by the palace as it was. (According to the three scrolls, there are no references in the Sakai and Maeda editions to the "Pillow for the Pillow" in the missing volume of the Nouin version and the "Pillow for the Pillow" in the complete volume of the Nouin version.)

It is commonly believed that the name "The Pillow Book" comes from there.

According to Kazuhiko Hayashi's "A Study of the Pillow Book," he cites his own theory and those of past scholars such as Kioki, Orikuchi Nobuo, and Ikeda Kamekami.

The following is a typical explanation of the meaning of the pillow.

Bedding: a pun based on the phrase "shiki (shiki → mattress)," which means "a pillow for the mattress.

Writer's Reference: Many chapters list poetic pillars, tips, and terminology.

Memorandum: A reminder that we should keep a copy of "Soshi" by our bedside as a reminder.

Treasured book theory

No Relation Explanation

However, there is still no common theory.

In "Eika Monogatari", "Pillow Book" was used as a common noun to describe the beautiful Kasane color.

According to the same epilogue, the first draft was written in 996, and was brought out from the author's house by Minamoto no Tsunebusa, a left lieutenant general, and spread throughout the world.

Some of the texts were written around the end of the Kan'hō era, and were continually added to.

The text of "The Pillow Book" in the ancient commentary on The Tale of Genji "Genji Monogatari Shimeisho" includes some passages not found in existing books, suggesting a complex process of composition.

The discrepancies between the two traditions are enormous.

It is in the form of a miscellaneous collection and consists of three volumes.

Various copies with an inscription dated 1228 by a man named Gijiro Uo, who is thought to be Fujiwara no Sadaie.

This copy from the early Kamakura period (1185-1333) is said to be the oldest manuscript of the Pillow Book.

Of these, the Sakai-bon series Gokōgenin-bon is included in the Gunshō Ruyuu in upper and lower volumes, and the three Sakai-bon types are included in the Shinkyō Gunshō Ruyuu.

In addition, since the Nouin version was used as the bottom copy in old printed editions in the early Edo period (Kan'ei era), it was combined with annotations such as "Pillow and Pillowside Notes" and "Pillow and Pillow, Spring Daybreak" (notes by Kitamura Kigin), and became a mainstream tradition in the modern era.

However, in 1946, Shigetaro Tanaka (1917-1987) reevaluated the three-volume second series, and after World War II, these were the only ones published and used as textbooks.

In addition, there is a seven-section scroll of "Pillow and Pillow Texts," a white illustrated scroll from the late Kamakura period (1185-1333), which appears to have used a three-volume version of the text of the lyrics.

The three-volume second series has more than 300 independent chapters.

The "Ruiju Chodan" is composed of a variety of passages, including "Ruju Chodan," which is a collection of "things" represented by "Insects," "Flowers," "Wonderful things," and "Beautiful things," "Zazo Chodan," which describes the author's daily life and observations of nature in the four seasons, and "Kaiso Chodan" (diary), which looks back on courtly society in the days around Empress Sadako when the author served in the imperial court.

However, some chapters are ambiguous in their classification (e.g., the first paragraph "Spring is Akebono" is classified as an essay, but there are objections to this classification).

The stories are written in a concise, colloquial Japanese style using hiragana, and are generally light-hearted and short, but sometimes contain a hint of sentimentality, reflecting the downfall of the Chūkanpaku family and the misfortune that befell Empress Sadako, the sovereign of the Chūkanpaku family.

The author's refined sense and keen eye for detail combined to create an aesthetic world of intellectual "hakashi" in contrast to the emotional "mono no ahare" of "The Tale of Genji".

In the analysis of steel samples with low carbon concentration by the combustion infrared absorption method, if standard samples with different carbon concentrations are used for respective comparisons, the analysis value/certified value will vary.

The carbon concentrations of the high carbon steel RMs (JSS 57-6/C: 0.52%) and the low carbon steel RMs (JSS 1203-2/C: 0.52%) are shown in Table 3.1. The results were compared and examined by using a high carbon content steel RM (JSS 57-6/C: 0.52 %) and a low carbon content steel RM (JSS 1203-2/C: 0.0096 %). The results were compared and discussed.

It was found that the analysis value for the high concentration calibration deviated significantly from the true value, and that the low concentration calibration tended to be closer to the true value.

Samples with extremely low carbon concentrations were analyzed using the low-concentration calibrator, and good results were obtained in terms of both concentration and reproducibility.

We investigated the effect of CO2 saturation pressure on nanofoam during foam molding of a block copolymer of styrene and perfluorooctyl ethyl methacrylate (PS-PFMA) with ultracritical CO2.

Thin films of PS-PFMA synthesized by continuous anionic polymerization were annealed at 60 °C for 1 h at a CO2 saturation pressure of 7.5 to 30 MPa. After annealing at 60 °C and CO2 saturation pressure of 7.5 to 30 MPa for 1 h, the films were depressurized at 0 °C and 0.5 MPa/min for foam molding. After annealing at 60 °C and CO2 saturation pressure of 7.5 to 30 MPa for 1 h, the film was depressurized at 0 °C and 0.5 MPa/min for foam forming.

As a result, CO2 resided in the spherical PFMA domains of the order of 10 nm with pro-CO2 properties, and the PFMA domains functioned as templates for foam formation.

The average diameter of the foam cells ranged from 10 to 30 nm, increasing up to 20 MPa and then decreasing.

Ellipsometer measurements of PS-PFMA before and after foaming showed that the refractive index decreased and the volume fraction of the foamed cell increased as the CO2 pressure increased.

We investigated the "ethanol macrocluster" formed by hydrogen bonding on the surface of glass spheres in an ethanol/cyclohexane two-component liquid using1 H-NMR spectroscopy.

Chemical shifts of OH, CH 2 , and CH 3 protons were measured with and without glass spheres in a two-component solution of ethanol and deuterated cyclohexane at ethanol concentrations.

As a result, the spectra caused by ethanol molecules in the bulk phase were affected by the addition of glass spheres, and at an ethanol concentration of about 2 mol%, the line of resonance between the OH and CH 2 protons became wider and further fragmented due to the addition of glass spheres.

This suggests that when the concentration of ethanol in the glass sphere is high, two types of ethanol clusters exist and that there is an exchange of ethanol molecules between the surface and bulk clusters.

As a part of the development of environmentally harmonized catalysts, inorganic-organic hybrid catalysts were prepared by immobilizing organic groups on various regular silicates, and their catalytic performances were investigated.

Here, post-synthesis treatment and organic group modification of borosilicate MCM-22 (MWW) were investigated.

MWW is a zeolite with two types of independent two-dimensional 10-membered ring pores and 12-membered ring supercages. The product immediately after crystallization forms a layered precursor, and upon sintering, the MWW structure is generated, which peels off in layers to expose the supercages, creating bowl-shaped 12-membered ring pockets on the outer surface.

It was thought that the pocket would be the binding site for the organic group and could be used for the reaction of large substrates.

The outer surface is increased by layer delamination and atomization is expected to further improve the performance of the catalyst.

We found that urethane synthesis using cyclic amines was possible using quaternary ammonium salts as ionic liquids.

However, when ethylmethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate-ene or trifluoromethylsulfonylimidoene was used, the yield of cyclic urethane was only 0 to 16 %.

The highest pressure dependence was observed at 10 MPa in terms of yield and selectivity.

The same tendency was observed when only supercritical carbon dioxide was used, and the reaction mechanism was assumed to be the same.

We studied the development of a new generation of fluorinated compounds as an alternative to CFCs that do not deplete the ozone layer and have less impact on global warming.

We have developed two unique fluorinated compounds with a five-membered ring structure (octafluorocyclopentene for dry etching in semiconductor manufacturing and heptafluorocyclopentane for use as a precision cleaning solvent) and developed manufacturing technology for these compounds.

These compounds are characterized by their lack of ozone-depleting power and low impact on global warming.

The feature of this technology is that it combines environmental compatibility and high performance through an original molecular design.

The novel and unique molecular structure of the five-membered ring provides high performance in cutting-edge fields.

To clarify the mass/length, radius, and density of fibers in the Cryogel network of low-temperature-induced fibrinogen gel, we measured the turbidity at 400-800 nm wavelength at 2 ºC.

Fibrinogen molecules aggregated into rods to form fibrinogen fibers, which were thicker and looser in structure than thrombin-induced fibrin fibers.

The effects of glucose, mannose, and dextran additions were also examined.

Addition of glucose and mannose slowed the low-temperature gelation, and a stereoisomerism effect was observed.

On the other hand, the addition of dextran promoted low-temperature gelation, and this effect increased as the molecular weight of dextran was increased.

Since the results obtained with cryogels are consistent with those of thrombin-induced fibrin gel, they may be useful for clarifying the mechanism of low-temperature gelation.

Recent advances in the selective synthesis of tertiary alcohols were presented.

How far can we go in creating the "ultimate alkylating agent" that minimizes basicity and maximizes nucleophilicity?

If the labeling analysis can be performed directly, it can be simplified compared to the conventional absorption and turbidimetric methods.

In this report, six organic reagents including sodium acetate and tartaric acid were analyzed by adding standard solutions of chloride, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfuric acid to the reagents.

Some samples could not be analyzed depending on elution time and conditions.

It was possible to conclude that other organic reagents could also be analyzed if elution conditions were set taking into account the elution time of the main components [1994.10]. 1994. 10]

We synthesized a high molecular weight liquid crystal (I) by photopolymerization of the homeotropic liquid crystal 4-(6-acryloxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid 4-biphenyl with 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as an initiator, and investigated its phase transfer behavior. Phenylacetophenone as an initiator, and investigated the phase transition behavior.

The liquid crystal monomer was in the nematic phase, while I exhibited nematic and smectic phases, and its isotropic temperature was higher than that of the monomer.

Homeotropically oriented I could be obtained by photopolymerization of homeotropically oriented oligomers obtained by thermal polymerization of liquid crystal monomer.

Photopolymerization of 4-biphenyl 4-(6-methacryloxyhexyloxy)benzoate exhibited the same homeotropic orientation as the liquid crystal monomer.

We designed an original lignin material that maximizes the properties of natural lignin, and also introduced the results of our study on its synthesis process.

As a process for inducing phenol-based lignin material, a phase separation system consisting of a concentrated acid-phenol derivative was effective.

We found that the molecular weight and phenolic activity of the ligno-phenol derivative can be precisely controlled by the appearance of an adjacent group effect on the Cβ position of the phenol nucleus in the derivative molecule.

By applying this process, it is possible to synthesize phenol lignin materials with different properties in high yield, and simultaneously supply the constituent carbohydrates as industrial materials in the form of monosaccharides.

On November 18, 2000, the Nagasaki University training ship Tsuruho Maru encountered the sea quake described above.

In this paper, we report on the results of the seaquake observations.

Sea tremors were observed four times in five hours from 7:00 to 12:00.

The time, place value, measured time (seconds), and seismic intensity based on the seismic intensity scale are shown.

This observation demonstrated that seismic motion propagates even at water depths of 5,000 m or more.

As a starting point for the formation of political will to coordinate and integrate the maritime policies of coastal states toward maritime governance in the Asian seas, a common understanding of the geographical characteristics of the Asian seas as semi-enclosed seas is necessary.

Semi-enclosed seas are extremely vulnerable environmentally and ecologically.

This is the most difficult area to integrate and manage.

In order to build political will for integrated management, a new concept of maritime governance, Securing the Ocean, should be introduced to unify maritime information among nations.

The need for information integration for effective policy making in marine management has been identified by the Partnership in Enviromental Management for the East Asia (PEMSEA).

The goal is to integrate and coordinate the perceptions of coastal communities regarding the ocean, and from there to change the framework of political decision-making and to develop political will.

Chapter 1 outlines the topography of Niijima and Shikinejima, including the seafloor, and the history of activities based on geological and petrological features and ejecta, and attempts to estimate the subsurface structure of Niijima based on artificial earthquake and electrical survey results.

Chapter 2 reconstructs the first eruption in the historical period based on ancient documents.

Chapter 3 describes the current seismic, geothermal, and other volcanic activities on the two islands based on observations.

Based on the results of geological investigations, if a future eruption were to occur, it is expected that extremely dangerous pyroclastic surges would be common in the early stages of activity.

From this standpoint, chapters 4 and 5 describe future activity forecasts, damage estimates based on these forecasts, and recommendations for countermeasures [1990. 5]. 5]

This was thought to be caused by the existence of water masses in contact with each other with little horizontal movement and vertical mixing, and the unique carbon cycle was activated by biological activity.

emitters and absorbers of carbon dioxide in Bingo-nada and Bingo-Seto, and Harima-nada was an absorber.

The conservation of the marshland environment is now an urgent priority.

The maintenance and conservation of the water environment is an essential issue for the conservation of wetlands, and it is necessary to clarify the water revenue and expenditure in the wetlands when implementing conservation measures.

The author and his colleagues conducted a survey of the Akaiyachi Marsh and examined the water yield of the marsh based on the measurement results of the amount of water discharged from the marsh and meteorological data.

The results showed that most of the lost rainfall was due to evapotranspiration and that the drought of 1994 caused changes in the runoff characteristics of the wetlands.

When sea breezes blow from the ocean to land, the temperature difference between the land surface (high temperature) and the sea surface (low temperature) creates an area of active convective mixing called the thermal interior boundary layer (TIBL) on land.

When TIBL is developing and there is a smoke source on the sea or near the coast and pollutants are emitted from the source, the diffusion process is interfered with by TIBL and high concentrations appear near the ground surface (fumigation phenomenon).

The atmospheric diffusion phenomenon of pollutants considering the TIBL was reproduced using a wind tunnel and compared with the results of numerical calculations and field measurements.

As a result, a good match was found.

As a method to search for extraterrestrial life, the authors began research to search for life forms (microorganisms) in space using light.

The fabrication of Si microprobe arrays that simultaneously measure and record the activity of neural networks at multiple points and the improvement of electrical characteristics were described.

The Si microprobes were grown on Si (111 ) substrates by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) crystal growth method using Au as a catalyst and Si 2 H 6 as the Si gas source.

He stated that this probe is a very useful sensing device for measuring nerve signals that show very small voltage changes of about 10 μV, and the size of this probe is suitable for recording nerve activity.

Comparing the measurement results of Au, Pt, and Ir electrodes, we found that the Ir electrode showed the lowest impedance at 1 kHz, the signal frequency of neural action potentials.

The authors have been searching for novel disease biomarkers based on glycoform focused reverse genomics (GFRG), which is a strategy that starts from comprehensive and quantitative glycan structural analysis, and goes back from analysis of peptide sequence information of glycan carrier proteins to identification of genomic information.

This paper describes new methodologies and structural analysis techniques that are essential to this approach.

The GFRG method is a method for proteome analysis and genome information acquisition by fishing glycopeptide fragments with glycans as tags, and for identification of glycoproteins and profiling of glycoprotein heterogeneity.

The specific method of the GFRG method was outlined, and the analysis results of glycoproteins distributed in mouse skin revealed by the GFRG method were shown as an actual example.

In addition, the problems and solutions in the structural analysis of trace glycans by the GFRG method were described.

The GFRG method analyzes the carrier protein from the sugar tag, and then backward to the gene structure, and is considered to be a promising strategy as one of the high-throughput search methods for new disease markers.

The horizontal stripes ranged from 17 to 26 in density and 22 in mode.

Mosses and lichens have the ability to live on the continent of Antarctica, where temperatures are low, liquid water is scarce, and the atmosphere is dry.

Mosses and lichens also change their rate of photosynthesis depending on light intensity, temperature, the amount of water on their surfaces, and the amount of water in their bodies.

The optimum temperature for photosynthesis was 10 to 16 °C for mosses and less than 10 °C for lichens in all but a few cases.

Mosses often grow in sandy areas with poor nutrition, and the nitrogen-fixing ability of the cyanobacteria attached to the moss surface cannot be ignored as a nutrient.

We found DNA specifically amplified from RNA derived from bovine peripheral blood, and considered this to be part of the macrophage colony-stimulating gene.

The synthesized cDNA was incorporated into λ gt 10, and the DNA obtained by PCR was screened as a probe.

Finally, two positive clones were obtained.

DNA was extracted from this bacteriophage and a bacteriophage 1 clone with an insert of about 4 kb was obtained by Southern blotting [1994. 3]

The effects of triene-type polyunsaturated fatty acids, monoene-type fatty acids, and diene-type fatty acids on lipid release, fatty acid uptake, and lipid metabolism-related enzyme activities in hepatocytes were compared.

The configurations of the catecholamine radical and Zn ions with water molecules and hydroxyl groups were calculated based on ESR measurements and spin densities from ab initio calculations.

The calculation of the system involving Zn is still in the process of being performed using a base function with low precision, and the calculation for the system of catecholamine radicals is still in progress.

In systems where alkali and earth metal ions chelate to ortho-semiquinone radicals (R), the charge O configuration is assumed to reflect the solution state.

The metal ions and hydroxyl groups have a significant effect on R. Consider that one metal ion is involved per molecule of R.

Anaerobic methane-producing bacteria were screened for the decomposition of the designated substance (Z) used in the LSI manufacturing process.

Anaerobic bacteria that can grow on anaerobic digestion sludge, river and sea mud, and sand as a colony source of Z were cultured and purified by colony formation.

Growth of the bacteria was observed only in the test tubes inoculated with seawater samples, and the fastest growing strain was isolated from sand in Tokyo Bay.

Based on the characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria, irregular spherocytes, GC content of 45%, non-use of formic acid, and use of methyl compounds, we identified it as a member of the family Methanosarcinaceae.

The amount of methane produced confirms that this strain completely decomposes Z into methane and ammonium.

The effects of various vasoactive drugs on the contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscle of the penile corpus cavernosum and the effects of testosterone on NO in the penile corpus cavernosum and dorsal nerve of the penis were investigated in rabbits.

The results suggest that the contractile response of α-agonists to the smooth muscle of the penile corpus cavernosum and the relaxation response of acetylcholine and VIP are influenced by the level of testosterone in the blood.

In particular, the α1-adrenergic receptor was shown to be mainly involved in the contractile response of the smooth muscle of the penile corpus cavernosum to castration.

Muscarinic receptors were shown to be involved in the relaxation response of the penile corpus cavernosum induced by castration.

NO, a chemotransmitter of erection induction, was also found to be affected by testosterone in the peripheral penile corpus cavernosum and dorsal penile nerve.

Using cultured lymphocyte chromosomes obtained from 63 Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors, we reported the results of G-band analysis of the form and frequency of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations.

Cells with stable-type anomalies accounted for the majority of anomalous cells, and the frequency of dose-dependent anomalies increased.

All stable anomalies were classified into nine groups: reciprocal translocations, complex translocations, insertions, pincer inversions, polarized inversions, terminal deletions, intermediate deletions, and indistinguishability.

A statistical analysis of the 3370 breaks associated with reciprocal translocations showed a high correlation between the relative amount of DNA and the distribution of chromosome breaks for each chromosome [1994.6]. 1994. 6]

We conducted a basic study for lecithin measurement and obtained the optimum conditions for converting lecithin to choline.

Optimal conditions for choline/acetylcholine measurement and glucose oxidase modification electrode fabrication were also determined.

In the immunosensor using IgG class-specific antibodies, the optimal incubation time of the antibody electrode and transferrin solution containing ferrocene-labeled antibodies was about 15 min, indicating that the gold-antibody electrode was superior.

The in vivo sensor was not able to completely remove the influence of the interfering substances in the organism and could not achieve this.

In the 5′ region, four types are found among Americans, but only three types are found among Japanese.

The proportion of D-type cells was the same in cerebral infarction cases as in normal subjects, but there were few D-type cells with low expression activity in myocardial infarction cases.

This may explain the high blood lipoprotein(a) levels in myocardial infarction patients.

The effect of UV-B irradiation on the ion transport system was examined in red yeast, which is known to induce carotenoid synthesis by UV-B irradiation.

As a result, we found that K+ is specifically emitted by UV-B.

The action spectrum of K + emission has a peak at around 270 nm, showing a sensitive wavelength dependence.

He stated that a photoreceptor absorbing around 270 nm may be involved.

This paper describes the preparation method of coated enzymes that exhibit enzymatic activity in organic media by covering lipase with a surfactant, and the reactions using the enzymes in organic solvents, focusing on the esterification reaction.

Lipase coated with a nonionic surfactant containing an oleyl group in the hydrophobic part of the molecule exhibits high enzymatic activity in isooctane.

Comparison of the esterification of benzyl alcohol and lauric acid with the powder enzyme as a model reaction showed that the activity was about 100 times higher.

The addition of aspartic acid and glutamine, which are considered effective for callus multiplication in Koshihikari, were rather inhibitory in IR 24.

It was best not to reduce the amount of elements in large amounts and the concentration of retained sugar.

Since the perception of color probably depends on subjectivity, it can be said that it is always an optical illusion.

In this study, we attempted to realize color illusions by engineering a mutually inhibitory neural network using 1) color simultaneous contrast illusion and 2) color appearance illusion as subjects.

Specifically, we assumed mutual inhibition dynamics between neurons located in the color space that is minimally required for color representation.

As a result of the computer simulation, for 1) and 2), we were able to reproduce on the computer the colors that showed the same tendency as the color appearance that humans subjectively perceive when looking at them.

Glucuronosyltransferase (GT), a rate-limiting enzyme for biosynthesis of HNK-1 glycoprotein, was investigated to elucidate the mechanism of autoimmune diseases by studying the biosynthesis and expression regulation mechanisms of HNK-1 glycoprotein.

The cDNA cloning of GT from rat brain revealed the base sequence of the clone and the amino acid sequence deduced from the clone.

The comparison results indicated that HNK-1 glycan antigens may also be expressed in nematodes and parasites, suggesting that GT is very well conserved in phylogeny.

In addition, forced expression of GT cDNA in cultured cells induced HNK-1 glycoprotein on the cell surface.

Furthermore, the mouse GT gene was isolated.

The paper focused on the monitoring function of the Australian beef industry, which has established a high level beef safety and quality assurance system, and how the system works and how it is systematically coordinated.

The Cattle Care Program is an important quality assurance program for Australian beef producers.

It is an accreditation system based on external audits in accordance with ISO 9002, and is designed to complement HACCP and guarantee a safe supply of beef cattle.

The feedlots operated under the national feedlot accreditation system have established manuals for feedlot feed ingredients, feeding period, and weights of feedlot cows to manage the health and production of their feedlot cattle.

Safety assurance systems are in place at all distribution stages.

Another feature of the Australian beef industry's safety assurance system is that after the distribution stage, a third-party organization audits the safety assurance efforts of each entity.

Using the example of a resource recycling project in Kunitomi-cho, Miyazaki Prefecture, we evaluated the environmental impact of recycling biomass resources.

For the purpose of evaluation, the flow of biomass resources and the generation of environmental load were summarized in a single accounting system.

The main body of the system clearly shows the complex flow of biomass resources and clarifies the extent of the environmental impact of the activities.

According to the biomass resource account of Kunitomi Town, the operation of the compost center reduced nitrogen oxides by 177 tons per year and nitrogen oxides by 752 tons per year.

Bluefin tuna, which swim at high speed, should preferably be stocked in large fish cages.

In order to design an optimal cove that takes into account the effects of tidal currents and waves, we introduced a method for formulating a mechanistic calculation model to calculate the underwater geometry of the net-like structure that constitutes the facility.

In this model, it is assumed that the reticulation consists of multiple masses and springs, that the masses are concentrated at the nodes, and that the masses are coupled to the springs whose masses can be ignored.

Using this computational model, we calculated the underwater geometry and working load of a large bluefin tuna cove for several flow conditions, and evaluated the facility's weather resistance.

In the future, we would like to calculate the movement, deformation, and forces acting on the entire cassette mooring system.

Because we saw a lot of damage from Amomoritodomatsu (Abies sachalinensis) sp. around the Shirasuna Marsh from Ozenuma to Miharu, we set up six survey trees in the Shirasuna area and visually observed changes in the lesion condition.

In the 2006 report, the foci had grown to 30 cm × 35 cm, compared to 10 cm × 15 cm in 2004.

There were no other signs that the lesions affected tree activity.

The distance from the tree line should also be examined to see the relationship with the natural environment of the site and human influence.

In Japan, the system and policies for environmentally friendly agriculture have been established, but at the same time, the economic efficiency of the agriculture is important.

This paper examines whether environmentally friendly agriculture can establish its own market and what kind of labeling and certification system is necessary to do so, based on the efforts in European countries.

In particular, we discussed IP (Integrated Production) in Switzerland and EUREPGAP.

In environmentally friendly agriculture, the social development of production standards and labeling/certification systems has great significance, and it has been shown that a price premium is added through the market for products that are evaluated to be environmentally superior.

The "MOS" from the Oike R&D Laboratory is made by vacuum evaporation of silicon oxides with a thickness of 30-80 nm onto a 12-μm-thick PET film.

MOS-TB (for boiling and general use) and MOS-TR (for retort use).

As a precaution in processing, since the silicon oxide film is easily damaged, other films should first be evaporated on the silicon oxide surface when manufacturing composite materials.

In addition, dry lamination was recommended as the preferred lamination method.

The culture composition and species selection of hatake shimeji were examined.

In the 13 cultures that combined the culture materials, sawdust, corncobs, orgeat, rice bran, and sawdust 4:4:4:2 (or 1) had the highest diameter of the bacteria.

Sawdust was better in conifers than in hardwoods.

Although the seven strains differed in terms of the shape and yield of the offspring, it was thought that the wide-mouth bottle with a large diameter was more suitable for cultivation of hatake shimeji [1993. 7]. 1993. 7]

Sud sprayers are necessary for growing fruit, including apples, but chemical exposure to operators during spraying has become a problem.

Therefore, we developed an unmanned fruit tree pest control robot with a guidance cable.

An auxiliary remote control unit, located away from the unmanned pest control robot, is used to start and stop the machine, drive and stop the blower, and start and stop the chemical spraying.

Equipped with safety devices such as automatic stop devices for traveling and spraying when obstacles are detected and automatic stop devices for the engine when obstacles are contacted.

In Hokkaido, where houses are increasingly required to be highly insulated and airtight, the windows at the openings must also be highly insulated, dewproof, airtight, watertight, and ventilation-resistant.

We have developed a wood sash that meets these performance requirements.

The "pin and taper mechanism for pressing fittings" was devised and used to achieve the objective by using a sliding difference window.

Double-paned windows with aluminum window frames on the outside and wood window frames on the inside

The objective was to develop all-male production techniques and breeding for superior traits in tilapia, which grow faster in males.

Estrone was added to the feed to increase T. nilotica production to 95.9%. The ratio of T. nilotica females to T. nilotica was 95.6%. The ratio of females was 95.6% for T. nilotica.

T . T. nilotica and T. aurea. In the first ovariectomized female development induction test using T. nilotica and T. aurea, the hatching rate tended to be higher in the 4-minute heat treatment.

Furthermore, we examined the success or failure of the induction of female development by isozyme analysis and the determination of sexually transgenic females.

This report summarizes the research findings of Toshiro Haseyama and Etsuko Chiba of the Faculty of Public Administration and Sociology at Fukushima University on "Community Center Activities and Community Vitality in the Mid-Mountainous Areas.

The introduction clarified the "perception of the problem.

In Part I, "Community Center Activities and the Vitality of Local Residents," we reported on: 1) community center-led activities in Suifu Village; 2) community center-led activities in Satomi Village; 3) community center activities in Satogawa that enhanced community vitality; and 4) community center management practices and community vitality.

Part II describes "district community centers and women's community activities," including: 1) location of the problem, 2) community center activities and women's learning, 3) community center activities and women's community activities, 4) life issues in mountainous areas, and 5) factors that have increased the vitality of women.

In the last chapter, he proposed a "policy for improving regional vitality in mountainous areas" (1995.9). 1995. 9]

In the development of lignin utilization, we examined the synthesis of phenol-based lignin derivatives based on the phase separation reaction system and the functional recycling composite combined with cellulose fiber.

Lignin cresol was synthesized by adding p-cresol and sulfuric acid to defatted black pine and maple wood chips and extracted with acetone.

Fiber mold made from recycled paper was dipped in a solution of lignin cresol, and a composite body was made by welding and heating it to investigate the functionality of the thermal melting process.

As a result, the composite had high strength properties, excellent hydrophobicity and dimensional stability.

The material can be separated and recovered into composite components by a simple solvent treatment.

This document reports the results of a survey on the effects of the poor agricultural management caused by cold damage to rice crops in Hokkaido and Tohoku in 1993 on the harvesting performance of forest reserves.
