Later, Jakuhara formed a sect, and so there were two schools of Shomyo in Ohara.

Later, Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo.

Tanchi established a flow based on new music theory .

Since then, it has become the core of Tendai Shomyo and has been inherited by the present-day Tendai Shomyo.

The chanting of the Yuzu Nembutsu sect, Jodo sect, and Jodo Shinshu sect is derived from Tendai chanting.

Shingon chanting was based on what was passed down by Kukai and has continued to the present day.

It was after Shinga that chanting began to be systematized.

Kancho in particular can be considered the founder of the revival of the system.

He was involved in composing and organizing Shomyo songs.

Up until the Kamakura period, there were many schools, but they were consolidated into four schools (Honsoin school, Shinsoin school, Daigo school, and Nakagawa Daishin school) by Prince Kakusho.

Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and was abolished during the Edo period.

The Honsoin school, Shinsoin school and Daigo school were abolished by the mid-Meiji period.

Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (Chishaku-in Temple, Kyoto), Buzan Shomyo (Hasedera Temple, Nara), and Nanzan Shinryu (Mount Koya, Kogi Shingon sect temple, Kyoto).

Chizan Shomyo and Toyozan Shomyo (Shomyo of the Shingon sect) The shomyo of both the Chizan school of Shingon Buddhism and the Toyozan school of Shingon Buddhism originally originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school.

Raiyu adopted Daigo&#39;s old school.

When Negoro-ji Temple (Wakayama Prefecture) fell into decline after being burned down by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1583 (Tensho 13), the Chizan and Toyozan schools came to form a single sect based on the old Daigo style.

The characteristics of these works are called Toyoyama&#39;s &quot;discussion&quot; and Chizan&#39;s &quot;statement.&quot;

Nanzan Shinryu (Ancient Shingon sect chanting) was based on Nakagawa Daishinryu.

The Nakagawa Daishin school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa Temple in Nara.

During the Joei era (1232-1233), Katsushin of Sanboin Temple in Renge-dani, Mount Koya, moved his base to Mount Koya.

Later, it was named Nanzan Shinryu, using Nanzan, another name for Mount Koya.

It is also called Shinryu and Noyama Shinryu .

Music such as Heikyoku, Yokyoku, folk songs, and Joruri can be said to be transformations of Shomyo.

It has had a great influence on monophonic music.

Emperor Tenchi (Tenchi Tennou/Tenji Tennou).

male .

34th year of the reign of Empress Suiko (626) - 10th year of the reign of Emperor Tenchi, December 3rd (January 7th, 672).

The 38th Emperor.

His posthumous name is Ame-mikoto Hirakasewake-no-mikoto (Amatsumikoto Sakiwake-no-mikoto).

His given name was Katsuragi (Kazuraki/Katsuragi).

It is believed that he was called Prince Katsuragi (Kazuraki no Miko/Katsuragi no Miko) during his lifetime.

He is commonly known as Prince Nakano Oe (Nakano Oe no Oji/Nakano Oe no Miko).

&quot;Oe&quot; means crown prince, and &quot;Nakano Oe&quot; means &quot;the next crown prince.&quot;

Overview

The second son of Emperor Jomei.

His mother was Princess Takara (later Empress Kogyoku).

The Empress was Princess Yamatohime, the daughter of his half-brother, Prince Otomo no Oe.

He conspired with Nakatomi Kamatari and others to stage a coup d&#39;état, assassinated Soga no Iruka, and placed his uncle, Emperor Kotoku, on the throne, with himself becoming crown prince.

He then established the era name Taika and carried out various reforms (the central figure of the Taika Reforms, the Isshi Incident).

He also set a trap for Prince Arima and other people who might later stage a coup d&#39;état, and executed them.

After Baekje was destroyed by the Tang and Silla dynasties in 660, he sent back Baekje prince Buyeo Pungjang, who had been residing at the royal court, and attempted to restore Baekje.

He stayed in Tsukushi to supervise the rescue of Baekje, but in 661, Empress Saimei passed away.

After that, he ruled for a long time without ascending to the throne, but after suffering a major defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663, he moved the capital to Otsu city and ascended to the throne there.

After the Battle of Baekgang, water castles, signal fires, and defenders were established as part of the national defense policy.

Furthermore, the rank system was also reformed, decreasing it from 19 ranks to 26 ranks.

He also had the oldest nationwide family register in Japan, the Kogo Nensei, compiled in 670.

The Nihon Shoki tells us that Emperor Tenchi wanted his first son, Prince Otomo, to succeed him to the throne.

However, after Tenchi&#39;s death, in the Jinshin War, his younger brother Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) defeated Prince Otomo and ascended to the throne.

After that, emperors of the Tenmu lineage continued up to Emperor Shotoku.

After Shotoku&#39;s death, Tenchi&#39;s grandson, Prince Shirakabe, ascended to the throne as Emperor Konin, and the lineage of Tenchi was established thereafter.

It is said that he had abducted Princess Nukata from Prince Oama, and so in order to atone for his sin, he sent his four daughters to Prince Oama as wives.

Biography

34th year of the reign of Empress Suiko (626) - Born

June 14, 4th year of the reign of Emperor Kogyoku (July 12, 645) - Appointed Crown Prince

24th July, 7th year of Saimei (24th August, 661) - Established

Tenchi 7th year January 3 (February 20, 668) - ascended to the throne

Tenchi 10th year December 3 (January 7, 672) - Died at age 46

(In the Fuso Ryakki, after the theory that he died of an illness, one theory states that &quot;Emperor Tenmu, who was carrying a kamayuki and travelling to Yamashina, never returned to his eternal relationship with the forest, collapsed without knowing where he had fallen, and the various emperors who lived near his tomb did not know where he had died, as was the usual occurrence, and he was murdered,&quot; and since he is said to have gone missing in the mountains, there is also a theory that he was assassinated by Emperor Tenmu&#39;s side.)

The fact that Emperor Tenchi did not reign for long is one of the mysteries of the political history of the mid-7th century.

There are several theories on this matter that are being debated.

Consideration was given to the forces supporting Emperor Tenmu.

In other words, the conventional theory that Emperor Tenmu was the younger brother of Emperor Tenchi is incorrect, and is based on the theory that he was a prince of Han born to Empress Kogyoku before she married Emperor Jomei, making him Emperor Tenchi&#39;s half-brother.

Indeed, if one calculates backwards from the birth years of Emperor Tenchi in the Nihon Shoki and Emperor Tenmu as recorded in some historical books, Tenmu would turn out to be the older of the two.

However, there are no contradictions found among the same historical documents, and many of them state an age difference of around 8 to 9 years.

In response to this, some argue that ``it would have been bad form to have the younger son take the place of the older brother, even though they had different fathers, so Tenji&#39;s age was intentionally raised,&#39;&#39; but ``the age of 16 for Tenji that appears in the Nihon Shoki was the age his father, Emperor Jomei, was when he ascended to the throne, but it was mistakenly written as the age he was when he died.

Therefore, his real birth year is 614, as adopted in Honcho Koin Shounroku and other documents.

&quot; He countered, &quot;It was not uncommon for the throne to be vacant in ancient times (in fact, Tenchi and Jito, who reigned before and after Tenmu, also proclaimed their status but did not ascend to the throne immediately).

) This is why an error occurred.

There are also those who argue that the &#39;Nihon Shoki&#39; and other historical books mentioned are compiled in different periods and have different characteristics, so they cannot be treated the same.

(See also &quot;Emperor Tenmu&#39;s Age&quot; section.)

One theory is that the Isshi Incident was a coup d&#39;état by Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku), and that Prince Nakano Oe was driven out of his position.

In recent years, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Nakano Oe and Soga no Iruka was relatively good, and that their basic policies were similar.

If that were to happen, Prince Nakano Oe would have no motive to kill Iruka.

Furthermore, since falsifications were found in the description of the Taika Reforms in the Nihon Shoki, this theory began to be put forward.

This theory has also attracted attention because it can explain other questions, such as the reason for Empress Kogyoku&#39;s abdication and why the Soga clan other than Iruka were not exiled after the coup d&#39;état.

One theory is that Tenchi&#39;s accession to the throne was delayed due to opposition to his relationships with women.

This is based on the idea that a poem written by Emperor Kotoku to his wife, Princess Omihito (Tenchi&#39;s full sister), which is recorded in the &quot;Nihon Shoki,&quot; contains a passage that suggests an adulterous relationship between her and Tenchi.

Love and marriage between half-brothers and sisters was permitted, but it was not permitted between full-brothers and sisters; this was the state of affairs in people&#39;s romantic relationships at the time, but in Machiko SATONAKASA&#39;s work &quot;Rainbow in the Sky,&quot; it is interpreted as actually being related, and there is a scene in which Prince Arima happens to see her having an affair after persuading her to marry his uncle, King Karu (Emperor Kotoku), and scolds her in a rage.

One theory is that after the death of Empress Saimei, Princess Ushio succeeded to the throne as the wife of the emperor before her, but for some reason the record was erased.

This comes from the theory that the person named &#39;Naka no Mikoto&#39; in the Manyoshu is Princess Ojin, and it is asserted that &#39;Naka no Mikoto&#39; can be interpreted as meaning that she was an interim emperor until Tenchi ascended to the throne.

If Princess Omi is the same as &#39;Naka no Komyo&#39;, it becomes clear why there was a need for her to be called by this special title, but there is also a theory that it was Empress Saimei, so there is no definite proof.

Due to the nature of political history and the constraints of historical materials, proving this is difficult, but we look forward to further developments in research, including in conjunction with archaeological findings.

Song

He was also a Man&#39;yo poet, with four poems preserved in the Man&#39;yoshu.

The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu also pays tribute to him as the founder of the Heian dynasty, and starts with the following poem:

As I dig through the faint straw of the autumn fields, my clothes and hands get wet with dew.

The following poem is also from the Manyoshu .

Kaguyama loves Unebi and fights with Miminashi. It seems that this has been the case since the Age of the Gods. Perhaps it is the same here, where the two of them are fighting over each other.

The Saionji family is a noble family descended from the Fujiwara clan.

The Fujiwara clan is a descendant of the Northern Fujiwara branch of the Kan&#39;in line, and is of the Seika family rank.

The Toin family and the Imadegawa family (Kikutei family) are branches of the Saionji family.

Additionally, the Saionji clan, a samurai family from Iyo Province, was an influential branch of the family that took the surname Saionji.

The family crest uses a three-comma motif on the left.

The Saionji family traces its origins to FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane.

During the time of Michisue&#39;s great-grandson, Kintsune SAIONJI, he was married to a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, and was therefore viewed with suspicion as a relative of the Kamakura shogunate during the Jokyu War and was confined by the Imperial Court; however, after the war he gained the trust of the shogunate and held real power in the Imperial Court as Kanto Magotsugi, and rose to the position of Grand Minister of State, thereby raising the family&#39;s status.

The name of the Saionji family comes from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his villa in Kyoto (Kitayamaso, Kazuno County, Yamashiro Province).

This hall is also known as Kitayamadono, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu on the land he received from the Saionji family.

Since Kintsune, the family received support from the Kamakura shogunate and had influence exceeding that of the regent families throughout the Kamakura period.

Sanekane SAIONJI got close to the Daikakuji line and gave his daughter to both Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.

However, after his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, the Daikakuji line began to distance itself from the shogunate, and they began to support the Jimyoin line, deepening their conflict with the Daikakuji line.

Later, during the reign of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Kamakura shogunate fell and he was dismissed from his position as Kanto Shinji.

Kinmune harbored Yasuie HOJO (Tokioki), a remnant of the Hojo clan, and planned a rebellion to assassinate Emperor Go-Daigo, who started the Kenmu Restoration, and install the Retired Emperor Go-Fushimi of the Jimyoin lineage; however, the plan was exposed through a tip-off from his younger brother, Kinshige SAIONJI, leading to Kinmune&#39;s arrest and execution.

During the Nanboku-cho period, Kinmune&#39;s son, SAIONJI Sanetoshi, served the Northern Court (Japan) and rose to the position of Minister of the Right, reviving the family name.

During the Muromachi and Edo periods, the family was known for its biwa playing business.

In the early Edo period, Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime, the eldest daughter of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA&#39;s eldest son (later dethroned), Tadataka HOSOKAWA, also known as Kyumu NAGAOKA, into his household and rose to the position of Minister of the Left; however, Kyumu NAGAOKA provided various financial assistance to the Saionji family and even bestowed them an inheritance of 600 koku (Cotton Thought Collection).

At the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted into the Tokudaiji family, also of the Kan&#39;in lineage, and after the Meiji Restoration he played an active role as a politician, successively serving as Prime Minister and other positions, and as a Genro (elder statesman) he played an influential role in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods.

Incidentally, Kinmochi was not good at playing the biwa, which was supposed to be the family business of the Saionji family, but there is an anecdote that while he was Prime Minister, Emperor Meiji half-jokingly said to Kinmochi, &quot;I want to hear the Saionji family&#39;s biwa for the first time in a long time,&quot; and Kinmochi struggled to play biwa with staff members of the Imperial Household Ministry&#39;s Gagaku Bureau.

Mount Hiei is a mountain that straddles the western part of Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture and the northeastern part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.

It is a general term for the twin peaks of Mt. O-Hiei (848.3 m), located on the prefectural border between Otsu City and Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, and Mt. Shimeigatake (838 m), located in Sakyo Ward.

The first-order triangulation point of O-Hiei is located in Otsu City.

Along with Mount Koya, it has been a sacred mountain since ancient times, and prospered with the establishment of Enryaku-ji Temple and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine.

It is included in Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).

It is also known by other names such as Mount Hiei, Hokurei, Mount Tendai, and Miyako Fuji.

overview

Located in the northeast of Kyoto, which is the evil direction, Mount Hiei was considered to be a mountain that protected the royal palace.

In the Kojiki, Mount Hiei is written as Hie-no-yama, and it is written that Oyamakui-no-kami is enshrined on Mount Hie in Omi Province, with a nakiyabura as its sacred object.

After Enryaku-ji Temple was established on Mt. Hie, Oyamakui-no-kami was regarded as the local deity and the patron deity of the Tendai sect and Enryaku-ji Temple, and Sanno faith in Oyamakui-no-kami spread.

Additionally, the Enryaku-ji Sennichi Kaihogyo pilgrimage, which involves walking and visiting the various temples on the summit of Mt. Hiei and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine at the foot of the mountain, is also held on the mountain, making it a sacred mountain.

Climbing is also popular, with representative trailheads including the Mica-zaka slope starting from Shugakuin in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, and the mountain trail that starts from the temple town of Sakamoto (Otsu City) on the Shiga Prefecture side and passes through Mudoji-dani.

Since ancient times, Kirizaka has been a route used by monks, warrior monks, and imperial envoys from the imperial court traveling between Kyoto and Enryaku-ji Temple, and even today it is a popular climber.

The Tokai Nature Trail, which runs from Otsu towards Ohara in Kyoto, passes through Yamauchi.

Since the summit can be reached by toll road, cable car, and ropeway, the area is visited by many tourists on weekends.

There used to be an amusement park on the summit of Mt. Hiei and an artificial ski slope, but they were both closed by 2002. The former site of the ski slope is now a cosmos garden, and the former site of the amusement park is now an art museum called the Garden Museum Hiei.

There was also Mori no Yuenchi (Mori no Yuenchi) at the foot of the mountain on the Kyoto side in Yase, but it also closed on November 30, 2001, and a members-only resort hotel was built on the site.

Great Hiei and Shimeidake

According to survey results by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, the eastern peak is called Dai-Hiei and the western peak is called Shimeidake, and collectively they are called Mt. Hiei.

In &#39;Point Records&#39;, the name of the first-order triangulation point located on the eastern peak is given as &#39;Mount Hiei&#39;.

This triangulation point is located on the border between Otsu City and Kyoto City, but is located in Otsu City.

When looking at Mt. Hiei from the Kyoto Basin, it is difficult to confirm the summit of Dai-Hiei, and Shimeidake is sometimes considered to be the summit of Mt. Hiei.

Keifuku Electric Railroad&#39;s Mount Hiei Ropeway has established the summit of Mt. Shimeidake as its Mount Hiei Summit Station.

There are many theories about the spelling or reading of Shimeidake, and in addition to &quot;Shimeigatake&quot; or &quot;Shimeidake&quot; according to the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, &quot;Place Names of Kyoto City&quot; lists &quot;Shimegatake&quot; and &quot;Shimyomine&quot;.

The alternate names for Mt. Hiei, Mount Tiantai and Mount Siming, are derived from Mount Tiantai and Mount Siming in the People&#39;s Republic of China, sacred mountains associated with the Tendai sect.

It is separated from the Tamba Highlands and the Hira Mountains by the Hanaore Fault.

For this reason, it is considered to belong to the Hiei Mountain Range or the Hiei-Daigo Mountain Range.

Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido

During the Edo period, there were 53 post stations on the Tokaido road that connected Edo (Nihonbashi (Chuo Ward, Tokyo)) and Kyoto (Sanjo Ohashi Bridge).

This will be explained in this section.

An ukiyo-e print by Utagawa Hiroshige depicting 53 post stations (or 55 including the starting and ending points) on the Tokaido road.

A Family Computer game released by Sunsoft.

→ Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido (game)

The Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido (Tokaido Gojusan Tsugi) refer to the 53 post towns located on the Tokaido, a major road (highway) that was one of the five Kinki and seven roads that were developed during the Edo period.

Many of these 53 post stations were established in locations of beautiful scenic beauty or famous places of interest or historical sites, and were often the subject of ukiyo-e, waka, and haiku poetry at the time.

When it is referred to as the Fifty-three Stations, it refers to the route up to Kyoto, and when it refers to the route up to Osaka, it becomes the Fifty-seven Stations.

Below, they are classified according to the names of provinces under the Ritsuryo system.

The numbers are consecutive numbers starting from Shinagawa post station.

* For municipalities that disappeared during the Heisei era mergers, the old names of the municipalities will also be listed.

Sanjo Ohashi Bridge (Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture)

According to one theory, Tokugawa Ieyasu set the number of stops from Edo (the impure land) to Kyoto (where Bodhisattva Fugen resides) to 53, based on a passage in the Avatamsaka Sutra&#39;s &quot;Entering the Dharma Realm&quot; in which the boy Zenzai was ordered by Bodhisattva Manjusri to go through 53 teachers before attaining enlightenment under Bodhisattva Fugen.

The post stations on the Kyoto Highway (Osaka Highway) were established in 1619 as an extension of the Tokaido Highway.

Sometimes the post towns on the Kyoto Kaido road are also included in the name of the Fifty-seven Stations of the Tokaido.

Furthermore, if you enter the Kyoto Highway from the Tokaido Highway, you do not go over Sanjo Ohashi Bridge, but take a route that turns southwest at Higechaya Oiwake (Oiwake-cho, Otsu City) (Otsu Highway), so the next post station after Otsu is Fushimi-juku.

They are classified according to the Ritsuryo system of countries .

The first number is by country.

The second number is a serial number from Shinagawa-juku (Musashi Province).

Note: This bridge used to be called Kyobashi (a bridge over the Neyagawa River on the border between Chuo Ward (Osaka City) and Miyakojima Ward in Osaka Prefecture).

&quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is an essay said to have been written by Sei Shonagon, a female writer from the mid-Heian period.

It is also written as &#39;Makura no Soshi&#39;, &#39;Makura Satsushi&#39;, &#39;Makura Soshi&#39;, and &#39;Shunshukebono Sho&#39;, and the oldest copy, the Maeda version, from the Kamakura period, is inscribed in a lacquer-e box as &#39;Sei Shonagon&#39;s Makura no Soshi&#39;.

It was also called &quot;Sei Shonagon-ki.&quot;

It is considered a masterpiece of medieval literature comparable to The Tale of Genji, and had a great influence on later linked verse, haikai, and kana-zoshi.

It is considered one of Japan&#39;s three great historical and satirical works, alongside Kamo no Chomei&#39;s &quot;Hojoki&quot; and Yoshida Kenko&#39;s &quot;Ireduregusa.&quot;

It has an extremely unique format, and although it has been noted that it bears some similarity to the earlier Yishan Zassan (Yishan Miscellany), compiled by the late Tang poet Li Shangyin (whose pen name was Yishan), no other similar books have been found.

According to the postscript at the end of the volume, the motivation for writing the work and the origin of the name are as follows: when the Minister of the Interior, FUJIWARA no Korechika, presented Emperor Ichijo with his younger sister, Empress FUJIWARA no Teishi, some paper, which was still expensive at the time, and the emperor asked Sei Shonagon, &quot;The emperor has copied the &#39;Records of the Grand Historian,&#39; but what about this?&quot; Sei Shonagon immediately replied, &quot;It should be used as a pillow.&quot;

And the Imperial Prince bestowed the paper as it was. (According to the three-volume version, the missing copy of the Noin version reads &quot;I would like to use this as a pillow,&quot; while the complete copy of the Noin version reads &quot;I would like to use this as a pillow.&quot; There is no corresponding article in the Sakai and Maeda versions.)

It is generally believed that the name &#39;The Pillow Book&#39; also comes from this.

According to Hayashi Kazuhiko&#39;s &quot;Study of The Pillow Book,&quot; he lists his own theory as well as that of previous researchers such as Keichu, Orikuchi Shinobu, and Ikeda Kikan.

Next, I will explain some representative theories about the meaning of pillows.

Bedding theory: A pun based on the word &quot;shiki (Records of the Grand Historian → Futon) tahe no makura&quot;

Theory that it is a dictionary for writers: Because it contains many chapters that list utamakura, tips, and terminology.

Memorandum theory: It means a book that should be kept at the bedside as a memorandum.

Secret Book Theory

No relation theory

However, there is no commonly accepted theory yet.

Also, in &quot;Eiga Monogatari,&quot; the word &quot;Makura no Soshi&quot; was used as a common noun to describe beautiful layered colors.

According to the postscript, the first draft was completed around 996, when Left Middle Captain MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa took it out of the author&#39;s home and made it widely available.

It was continually expanded upon after that, and some passages appear to have been written towards the end of the Kanko era.

Some parts of &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; cited in &quot;The Tale of Genji: Shimeisho,&quot; an ancient commentary on &quot;The Tale of Genji,&quot; do not exist in extant versions, suggesting a complicated process for its creation.

The differences between the original versions are enormous.

It is in the form of a miscellany and consists of three volumes.

These copies have a colophon dated 1228 and written by a man named Soki Guo who is believed to be Fujiwara no Teika.

It is &quot;clear in meaning&quot; and easy to decipher, and is thought to be closest to the ancient form.

Furthermore, Ikeda Kikan distinguished between two types.

Class 1 book (Class A): A handed down copy that omits the first 70 stories, including &quot;Spring is the Dawn,&quot; and starts with &quot;Something Comfortable.&quot;

Episode 230.

Yomei Bunko, Imperial Household Agency Archives and Mausolea Department Library Bureau, Takamatsunomiya Family Library

Category 2 (Category B) - 300 chapters.

Formerly owned by Yatomi Hamao, Kariya Library, Formerly owned by the Date family, Formerly owned by the Kanshuji family, Formerly owned by Nakamura Akika, Formerly owned by the Kozusado Bunko

This lineage is said to have been transmitted through Noin Hoshi, who was related by marriage to Sei Shonagon (one of whose sisters was the wife of Sei Shonagon&#39;s biological son, TACHIBANA Norinaga).

It dates back to the end of the Kamakura period .

As a result of the debate over which version was better, between the three-volume version and the original, it is now generally accepted that the original Noin version is inferior.

The book has 230 chapters, excluding the first 70 chapters.

300 Storybook

It takes a typological form .

A handed down copy from the Muromachi period.

It is called the Sakai version because there is a postscript that says that KIYOHARA Shigenobu copied the original that was owned by Doha, a reclusive monk who lived in Sakai.

Volume 2.

It lacks diary and memoir chapters.

Gokogon-in version - 190 chapters.

There is a postscript that says it was copied by Emperor Go-Kogon.

Chen Hanben.

95 storybook.

A combination of the above two types .

This is what is generally referred to as the Sakai version.

Volume 1, Chapter 107.

Volume 2, Chapter 89.

Volume 3, Chapter 102.

4 words and 32 words.

Volume 5 lost?

It takes a typological form .

The only copy in existence is one handed down by the Maeda family in Kaga Province (owned by the Maeda Ikutoku Association).

It comes in a gold lacquer box with the words &quot;Sei Shonagon&#39;s Pillow Book&quot; inscribed on the box in gold inlay.

It is an Important Cultural Property .

It was copied in the early Kamakura period and is said to be the oldest known manuscript of &quot;The Pillow Book.&quot;

Of these, the Gokogon-in version of the Sakai version is included in two separate volumes in &quot;Gunsho Ruiju,&quot; and the three types of Sakai version are included in &quot;Shinko Gunsho Ruiju.&quot;

Furthermore, since Noin&#39;s version was used as the basis for old movable type editions in the early Edo period (the Kan&#39;ei era), it was accompanied by commentaries such as &quot;Makura no Soshi Side Notes&quot; and &quot;Makura no Soshi Harunakebono Sho&quot; (annotated by Kigin Kitamura) and constituted the majority of handed down versions until modern times.

However, in 1946, the three-volume, type 2 edition was reevaluated by Tanaka Jutaro (1917-1987), and after World War II, it was the edition that was published, adopted as a textbook, and became the one that was read most widely.

Additionally, seven sections of the illustrated scroll &quot;The Pillow Book Ekotoba,&quot; written in white ink and created in the late Kamakura period, which is believed to have used the original three-volume version for its legend text, still remain.

The three-volume second type edition has a total of over 300 independent chapters.

It is made up of a wide variety of pieces, including the &quot;Collection of Items&quot; section of the &quot;Mono wa Zukushi&quot; series, which is typified by such passages as &quot;Insects,&quot; &quot;Flowers on the Trees,&quot; &quot;Terrifying Creatures,&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Creatures,&quot; as well as &quot;Essays&quot; that observe daily life and the natural world of the four seasons, and &quot;Recollections&quot; (Diary Sections) that look back on the court society around Empress Teishi, where the author served.

However, there are some chapters whose classification is unclear (for example, the first chapter, &quot;Spring is the Dawn,&quot; is generally considered to be a essay chapter, but this is disputed).

Written in a simple, colloquial style using hiragana, the short stories are generally light-hearted and witty, but at times they contain a subtle sentimental outpouring of emotion, reflecting the decline of the Nakakanpaku family and the misfortune that had befallen his master, Empress Teishi.

The author&#39;s refined sense and sharp observation of things combined to create a beautiful world of intellectual wo-kashi, in contrast to the emotional &#39;mono no aware&#39; of The Tale of Genji.

When analyzing steel samples with low carbon concentrations using the combustion infrared absorption method, the analytical/certified values vary when each sample is calibrated using standard samples with different carbon concentrations.

Calibration was performed using a steel standard material with a high carbon concentration (JSS 57-6/C: 0.52%) and a steel standard material with a low carbon concentration (JSS 1203-2/C: 0.0096%), and the two were compared and examined.

It was found that the analytical values for the high-concentration calibration deviated significantly from the true values, while the low-concentration calibration tended to be closer to the true values.

Using low-concentration calibration, samples with extremely low carbon concentrations were analyzed, and good results were obtained in terms of both concentration and reproducibility.

The effect of CO2 saturation pressure on nanofoams produced by foaming a block copolymer of styrene and perfluorooctyl ethyl methacrylate (PS-PFMA) using supercritical CO2 was investigated.

A thin film of PS-PFMA synthesized by successive anionic polymerization was annealed at 60 °C and CO2 saturation pressure of 7.5 to 30 MPa for 1 h, and then depressurized at 0 °C and 0.5 MPa/min for foam molding.

As a result, it was found that CO2 was present in the CO2-philic spherical PFMA domains of the order of 10 nm, and the PFMA domains functioned as templates for foam formation.

The average diameter of the foam cells was 10-30 nm and increased up to 20 MPa and then decreased.

Ellipsometer measurements before and after foaming of PS-PFMA showed that as the CO2 pressure increased, the refractive index decreased and the volume fraction of the foam cells increased.

&quot;Ethanol macroclusters&quot; formed by hydrogen bonding on the surface of glass spheres in an ethanol/cyclohexane binary liquid were investigated using 1H-NMR spectroscopy.

Chemical shifts of mainly OH, CH2 and CH3 protons were measured for ethanol/deuterated cyclohexane binary solutions with and without glass spheres at various ethanol concentrations.

As a result, the spectrum due to ethanol molecules in the bulk phase was affected by the addition of glass spheres, and at an ethanol concentration of approximately 2 mol %, the resonance lines of OH and CH2 protons became broader and more split by the addition of glass spheres.

This suggests that when the ethanol concentration is high in the presence of glass spheres, two types of ethanol clusters exist and that there is an exchange of ethanol molecules between the surface and bulk clusters.

As part of the development of environmentally friendly catalysts, we have prepared inorganic-organic hybrid catalysts by immobilizing organic groups on various regular silicates and investigated their catalytic performance.

Here, we investigated post-synthesis treatment and organic group modification of borosilicate-type MCM-22 (MWW).

MWW is a zeolite with two independent types of two-dimensional 10-membered ring pores and 12-membered ring supercages. Immediately after crystallization, the product forms a layered precursor, and upon calcination, an MWW structure is produced. This layered precursor peels off to expose the supercages, forming bowl-shaped 12-membered ring pockets on the outer surface.

It was thought that the area near this pocket could serve as a binding site for organic groups and could be used for reactions of large substrates.

In addition, by increasing the outer surface area through layer peeling and reducing the particle size, it is expected that the performance of this catalyst will be further improved.

We found that it is possible to synthesize urethane using cyclic amines by using quaternary ammonium salts as ionic liquids.

However, when ethylmethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ene or trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide ene was used, the yield of cyclic urethanes was only 0 to 16%.

As for the pressure dependence, the yield and selectivity were highest at 10 MPa.

The same trend was observed when only supercritical carbon dioxide was used, and the reaction mechanism was assumed to be similar.

We investigated the development of a new generation of fluorine-based compounds that have no ozone depletion effect and have little impact on global warming as alternatives to CFCs.

We have commercialized two original fluorine-based compounds with five-membered ring structures (octafluorocyclopentene for use in dry etching in semiconductor manufacturing and heptafluorocyclopentane for use as a precision cleaning solvent) and developed their manufacturing technology.

These compounds are characterized by the fact that they do not have the potential to deplete the ozone layer and have little impact on global warming.

The distinctive feature of this technology is that it achieves both environmental compatibility and high performance through original molecular design.

Due to its novel and unique molecular structure that takes advantage of the properties of the five-membered ring, it has high performance that is suited to cutting-edge fields.

To characterize the mass/length, radius and density of fibers in the &quot;cryogel&quot; network of low-temperature induced fibrinogen gels, the turbidity was measured at 2°C from 400 to 800 nm wavelength.

Fibrinogen molecules aggregated into rod - like structures to form fibrinogen fibers that were thicker and looser than thrombin - induced fibrin fibers .

Furthermore, the effects of adding glucose, mannose and dextran were investigated.

The addition of glucose and mannose slowed down low-temperature gelation, indicating a stereoisomerism effect.

On the other hand, the addition of dextran promoted low-temperature gelation, and this effect increased with increasing molecular weight of dextran.

Since the results obtained with these cryogels are consistent with those of thrombin-induced fibrin gels, we believe that they will be useful in elucidating the mechanism of low-temperature gelation.

Recent progress in the selective synthesis of tertiary alcohols has been reviewed.

How far can we go in creating the &quot;ultimate alkylating agent&quot; by minimizing basicity and maximizing nucleophilicity?

The progress of stoichiometric alkyl addition reactions, stoichiometric alkyl addition reactions catalyzed by Mg ate complexes (R3MgLi·LiX), and catalytic alkyl addition reactions catalyzed by Zn ate complexes were explained.

This method, utilizing highly active zinc ate complexes, is groundbreaking in that it enables catalytic control of the Grignard reaction under mild conditions.

I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what happens next.

We reported precise observation experiments and a theoretical model of the hardening process aimed at improving the processing accuracy of the stereolithography process.

To investigate the growth process of the minimum hardening units, the exposure time to ultraviolet light was varied and observations were made.

In this case, the incident light was parallel so that the light intensity did not change in the direction of travel.

Through experimental and theoretical investigations, the growth process was clarified and a method for simulating the hardening growth process was established.

We developed a new rewritable optical recording material using a dye mixed film with a conjugated polymer matrix, and investigated its recording principle and dynamic recording characteristics.

Poly(3-alkylthiophene) was synthesized as the conjugated polymer and a naphthalocyanine dye was synthesized as the dye, and a thin film was formed on a glass substrate by spin coating.

The film showed reversible optical changes upon heating and cooling.

An evaluation of the practicality of disc storage revealed the possibility of rewriting.

Close-up color photographs of colloidal single crystals formed in a flat quartz cell (width/optical path length = 10 mm) containing a dispersion of silica particles (particle size 103 nm) were shown and explained.

Crystal structures emerge from an extremely simple principle: they constantly seek to reduce dead space as much as possible.

When the relationship D ≦ Deff holds between the interparticle distance (D) and the effective diameter (D eff) of the particles including the electric double layer, the particles simply vibrate at their equilibrium positions and become crystalline.

The elastic modulus, viscosity, and response to external fields of colloidal crystal systems are described.

If the above analysis were possible directly, the procedure would be simpler than conventional absorbance analysis or turbidimetric methods.

In this paper, standard solutions of the analyte ions chloride, nitric acid, phosphate, and sulfate were added to six organic reagents, including sodium acetate and tartaric acid, and then the samples were analyzed.

Depending on the elution time and conditions, some samples could not be analyzed.

It was concluded that other organic reagents can also be analyzed if the elution conditions are set taking into account the elution time of the main components [1994.10]

A homeotropic liquid crystal polymer (I) was synthesized by photopolymerization of the homeotropic liquid crystal 4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid 4-biphenyl using 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as an initiator, and its phase transition behavior was investigated.

The liquid crystal monomer was in a nematic phase, but I exhibited nematic and smectic phases and its isotropy temperature was higher than that of the monomer.

Homeotropically oriented I was obtained by photopolymerization of homeotropically oriented oligomers obtained by thermal polymerization of liquid crystal monomers.

The photopolymerized 4-(6-methacryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoic acid 4-biphenyl exhibited homeotropic alignment similar to that of the liquid crystal monomer.

We presented the results of designing an original lignin material that makes the most of the properties of natural lignin and investigating its synthesis process.

As a process for deriving phenolic lignin materials, a phase separation system treatment method consisting of concentrated acid-phenol derivatives was found to be effective.

It was found that the molecular weight and phenol activity of lignophenol derivatives can be precisely controlled by expressing the neighboring group effect at the Cβ position of the phenol nucleus in the molecule.

By applying this process, it is possible to synthesize phenolic lignin materials with different properties in high yields, and at the same time, it is possible to supply the constituent carbohydrates in the form of monosaccharides as industrial materials.

On November 18, 2000, Nagasaki University&#39;s training ship, Kakuyo Maru, encountered the seaquake described above.

In this paper, we report on the results of seaquake observations.

Four seaquakes were observed in a five-hour period between 7:00 and 12:00.

The time, position, measured time (in seconds) and seismic intensity of the seaquake according to the seismic intensity scale table are shown.

These observations demonstrated that seismic motion can propagate at depths of more than 5,000 m.

As a starting point for forming the political will to coordinate and integrate the marine policies of coastal countries toward ocean governance in the Asian seas, a common understanding is needed that the Asian seas have the geographical characteristic of being semi-enclosed seas.

Semi-enclosed seas are extremely fragile environmentally and ecologically.

This is the area where integrated management is most difficult.

Therefore, in order to form political will for integrated management, new concepts such as ocean governance and &quot;Securing the Ocean&quot; must be introduced, and we must aim to unify marine information among countries.

The Partnership in Environmental Management for East Asia (PEMSEA) has pointed out that information integration is necessary for effective decision-making in marine management.

The goal is to integrate and coordinate the marine perceptions of coastal communities, and then change the framework for political decision-making and foster political will.

This report is the result of a survey conducted in 1988.

The first chapter provides an overview of the topography, including the seafloor, of Niijima and Shikinejima, as well as the geological and rock characteristics and history of volcanic activity based on volcanic eruptions. In Niijima, the author attempts to estimate the underground structure based on the results of artificial earthquakes and electrical exploration.

Chapter 2 reconstructs a single historical eruption based on ancient documents.

Chapter 3 describes the current earthquakes, geothermal activity, and volcanic activity on both islands based on observational results.

Geological surveys indicate that if a future eruption were to occur, the initial stage of activity would be characterized by numerous and extremely dangerous pyroclastic surges.

From this perspective, chapters 4 and 5 present predictions of future activity, estimates of damage based on them, and proposals for countermeasures (May 1990).

He introduced the cooling system that was developed and is used at the Planetary Experiment Laboratory of the Faculty of Science at the University of Tokyo.

An explanation of He and Ne separation is given, and the adsorption/desorption curves (temperature - % gas released) with temperature changes are shown.

In addition, the adsorption/desorption curves of Ar, Kr, and Xe with temperature changes are shown.

The temperature control system was also described.

In order to elucidate the atmosphere-ocean exchange of carbon dioxide, the above-mentioned survey was conducted from August 2nd to 3rd, 1994.

Discontinuities in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in seawater were observed near the boundaries of each ocean area.

This was thought to be due to the presence of water masses in contact with each other with little horizontal movement or vertical mixing, and a unique carbon cycle driven by biological activity.

Calculation of CO2 concentration showed that Bingo-Nada and Bingo-Seto were emitters of carbon dioxide, and Harima-Nada was a sink.

Currently, there is an urgent need to conserve the marshland environment.

The conservation of wetlands requires the development and preservation of the water environment, and when taking conservation measures it is necessary to clarify the water balance in the wetlands.

Therefore, the authors conducted a study of the Akai-yachi marsh and examined the marsh&#39;s water balance based on measurements of runoff water volume from the marsh and meteorological data.

The results showed that much of the rainfall loss was due to evapotranspiration, and that the drought of 1994 had caused changes in the marsh&#39;s runoff characteristics.

When a sea breeze blows from the sea toward the land, the temperature difference between the land surface (high temperature) and the sea surface (low temperature) creates an area of active convective mixing over land called the thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL).

When the TIBL is developing and there is a smoke source over the ocean or near the coast from which pollutants are emitted, the diffusion process is interfered with by the TIBL, resulting in a phenomenon known as fumigation, in which high concentrations appear near the ground surface.

The atmospheric diffusion phenomenon of pollutants taking into account this TIBL was reproduced using a wind tunnel, and the results of numerical calculations were compared with on-site measurement results.

The results showed good agreement.

As a method of searching for extraterrestrial life, the authors have begun research into using light to search for life forms (microorganisms) in space.

Recent research information on Mars suggests the possibility of life existing on Mars.

For this reason, microorganisms that have a high possibility of being life were the subject of life exploration methods.

We decided to use microfluorescence, which detects living organisms using fluorescent dyes, as a suitable exploration method.

The principles of the detection method, sample measurement methods and equipment, and organic matter mass analysis are described.

Human chromosomes are described by symbolizing the bands stained by chromosome banding according to naming conventions.

All chromosome test reports are written using this karyotype description method, which makes it possible to determine what abnormalities are present.

In this report, we explained what chromosome bands are, the banding method (symbolization used to describe the banding method, schematic diagram of human chromosome bands using the banding method), and chromosome boundary markers, regions, and bands (bands as chromosome boundary markers).

Chromosome bands should be described first with the chromosome number, then the chromosome arm designation, the region number, and the band number.

Computational biomechanical simulation involves three steps: modeling, computation, and visualization, with modeling being the first and most important step.

For clinical applications, patient modeling requires special attention in terms of both accuracy and speed.

In particular, in cardiovascular medicine, there are strict time constraints that directly affect the patient&#39;s life.

In this study, we attempted to develop an interactive clinical interface for MR imaging and computational mechanical modeling of the human cardiovascular system.

Existing methods for analyzing glycan structure involve a combination of processes such as the extraction of glycans from complex carbohydrates (glycans bound to molecules such as proteins), separation and purification, and fluorescent labeling, which require complex operations and time, and require expertise to obtain accurate data.

For further development of glycan research, it is essential to establish methodologies for easy preparation of glycan samples and to have commercially available kits.

Regarding the title, we provided a schematic diagram of glycan purification by selective capture of glycans (glycoblotting), explained polymeric microparticles with glycan-capturing properties, and gave an example of glycan analysis in human serum (MALDI-TOF mass spectrum).

Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. plans to commercialize the glycoblotting technique as a kit and sell it both in Japan and overseas as a complex carbohydrate glycan purification kit called &quot;BlotGlyco (trademark).&quot;

As part of post-genomic research, the authors introduced their efforts in analyzing the three-dimensional structure of proteins involved in development and differentiation, and DNA replication and repair.

X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance are used to analyze the three-dimensional structure of proteins, and these techniques are outlined below.

It was also stated that by combining three-dimensional structural analysis with biochemical techniques, it is possible to elucidate the function and mechanism of action of proteins.

He also mentioned that he is conducting food engineering research on polyphenols using nuclear magnetic resonance and other techniques.

We described the fabrication of a Si microprobe array capable of simultaneously measuring and recording neural network activity at multiple points and the improvement of its electrical characteristics.

The Si microprobe was fabricated on a Si (111) substrate by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) crystal growth method using Au as a catalyst and Si2H6 as the Si gas source.

It was stated that this probe is a very useful detection device for measuring nerve signals that exhibit very small voltage changes of around 10 μV, and that the size of the probe is suitable for recording nerve activity.

Comparing the measurement results of Au electrodes, Pt electrodes, and Ir electrodes, the report stated that Ir electrodes showed the lowest impedance at a signal frequency of 1 kHz, which is the frequency of nerve action potentials.

Starting with comprehensive and quantitative glycan structural analysis, the authors are currently searching for new disease biomarkers using glycoform-focused reverse genomics (GFRG) as a basic strategy, which involves analyzing peptide sequence information of glycan carrier proteins and then tracing back to identify genomic information.

In this paper, we report on new methodologies and structural analysis techniques that are essential for this approach.

The GFRG method treats sugars as tags to extract glycopeptide fragments, and then performs proteome analysis and acquires genomic information to identify glycoproteins and perform profiling of sugar heterogeneity.

We outlined the specific techniques of the GFRG method and presented, as an example, the results of an analysis of glycoproteins distributed in mouse skin that were revealed by the GFRG method.

Furthermore, we discussed the challenges and solutions in trace glycan structure analysis using the GFRG method.

The GFRG method reverse-analyzes the structure of the carrier protein and then the gene from the saccharide tag, and we believe that this is a promising strategy for high-throughput discovery of new disease markers.

Linear pulse motors for implantable artificial hearts have a unique and complex shape due to the circumstances of their use.

We proposed a method to perform magnetic field analysis efficiently in terms of calculation time , required memory , cost , etc.

Furthermore, the characteristics of thrust and self-starting frequency were calculated from the analysis results and compared with the measured values.

To improve accuracy, it is essential to consider the magnetic anisotropy of the laminated core and the nonlinearity of the core.

To objectively evaluate the effectiveness of road greening trees in improving the growing environment, it is useful to use the growth rate of trees.

Taking advantage of the fact that the amount of growth is equal to the amount of carbon dioxide fixed, we analyzed the carbon dioxide fixation function of road greening trees.

This report presents detailed nationwide and basic data, and compiles information such as the characteristics of tree species and simple methods for measuring the amount of carbon dioxide fixed.

Regarding the study of carbon dioxide fixation, we reported on 1) changes in the amount of carbon dioxide fixation (tree ring survey), 2) the relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide fixation and the size of trees, 3) a simple method for measuring carbon dioxide, 4) an examination of the amount of nitrogen dioxide and other absorption, and 5) net production and the structure of forest belts, etc. [1992.3]

Auditory evoked magnetoencephalograms with latencies of 10 to 70 ms were measured and analyzed to determine the location and nature of their source.

The auditory stimulus was a 1.0 ms click delivered to one ear of the examiner, with an interstimulus interval of 5-10 s.

A continuous masking noise was presented to the ear contralateral to the stimulation.

The evoked magnetoencephalogram was measured using a 7-channel first-order differential dc-SQUID at 42 to 49 points around the temporal region on the side opposite to the stimulation.

This paper mainly describes the authors&#39; research on the preparation of surfactant-coated enzymes and esterification reactions in non-aqueous media.

Preparation methods include the water dispersion method, the mixing method, and the emulsion method.

This enzyme activity depends primarily on the pH of the buffer in which the enzyme is dissolved during preparation.

Enantioselective esterification and regioselective esterification reactions using surfactant-coated enzymes were introduced and their kinetics were discussed.

Morphological variation of Eunotia exigua was investigated using samples collected from Lake Osorezan in Aomori Prefecture in June 1993.

Shell length 5.0 to 48.0 μm, mode 15.0 to 19.5 μm.

The width of the shell is 3.0 to 5.5 μm, with a mode of 4.0 μm.

The line density was 17-26 lines and the mode was 22 lines.

Mosses and lichens have unique characteristics that allow them to survive in Antarctica, where temperatures are low, liquid water is scarce, and the atmosphere is dry.

The rate of photosynthesis in mosses and lichens changes depending on light intensity, temperature, the amount of water on their surface, and the amount of water inside their bodies.

The optimum temperature for photosynthesis in mosses was 10 to 16 degrees Celsius, while in lichens, with a few exceptions, it was below 10 degrees Celsius.

Mosses often grow on nutrient-poor sandy soils, and the nitrogen fixing ability of the blue-green algae that grow on the surface of the moss cannot be ignored as a source of nutrients.

We found that DNA was specifically amplified from RNA derived from bovine peripheral blood and that this was thought to be part of the macrophage colony - stimulating gene .

The synthesized cDNA was inserted into λgt10, and the DNA obtained by PCR was used as a probe for selection.

Finally, two positive clones were obtained.

DNA was extracted from this phage, and a phage 1 clone with an insert of about 4 kb was obtained by Southern blot analysis [March 1994].

The effects of triene-type polyunsaturated fatty acids, monoene-type fatty acids, and diene-type fatty acids on lipid release, fatty acid uptake, and lipid metabolism-related enzyme activity in hepatocytes were compared.

The amounts of triglyceride and cholesterol released from each fatty acid were compared after 2 to 24 hours of culture.

We also looked at the effects on glucose phosphate dehydrogenase and other enzymes.

The triene type had a different effect compared to the other two [1994.3]

Fibroblasts (F) were suspended in gelled collagen 1 and their adhesion to collagen (C) was examined.

As a result, it was shown that F accelerates the volumetric shrinkage of C during aging, and the process by which F shrinks collagen gel was also clarified.

The cell proliferation rate of tumor cells (human fibrosarcoma cell line) decreased depending on the concentration of C gel and did not increase indefinitely.

Cytochalasin D induced bipolarity towards F in C gels.

Thus, it was suggested that cytochalasin D alters the cytoskeleton [995.1].

In addition to existing lectins, we have purified new lectins, such as Triticum vulgare lectin (T).

These were adsorbed onto Sepharose to create 10 types of columns.

Tritium-labeled samples were tested and systematically adsorbed onto these columns, and the glycan structures of the samples were clarified.

The test materials used were recombinant human lymphotoxin and human serum cholinesterase from healthy subjects and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and the glycan structures of each were elucidated.

In addition, fetal antigens in digestive cancer were stained with T lectin, making it possible to determine differentiated colon cancer [1995.2].

Magnetic bacteria, which have magnetic particles within their bodies, are bacteria that can sense the earth&#39;s magnetic field and swim along magnetic field lines.

Magnetic microparticles of magnetite measuring approximately 50 to 100 nm are synthesized within the bacteria.

We characterized magnetic bacteria and magnetic bacterial particles.

Its applications include immunoassays using antibody-immobilized bacterial magnetic particles, immunoassays using chemiluminescence, and drug delivery using magnetoliposomes.

The configurational relationship of the catecholamine radical and Zn ion to the water molecules and hydroxyl groups was calculated based on ESR measurements and spin density from ab initio calculations.

For systems involving Zn, calculations are still being performed using low-precision basis functions, and calculations for systems involving catecholamine radicals are still in progress.

In systems in which alkali metal and earth metal ions are chelated to ortho-semiquinone radicals (R), it is presumed that the configuration of charge O reflects the state of the solution.

It is believed that metal ions and hydroxyl groups have a large effect on R, and one metal ion is involved in one R molecule.

Anaerobic methanogens were screened for the purpose of decomposing the title substance (Z) used in the LSI manufacturing process.

Anaerobic digestion sludge, mud and sand from rivers and the sea were used as inoculum sources, and anaerobic bacteria that can grow using Z as the sole energy source were enriched and cultured, and purified by colony formation.

Bacterial growth was observed only in test tubes inoculated with seawater samples, and the fastest growing strain was isolated from sand in Tokyo Bay.

Based on its characteristics of being a gram-positive, irregular cocci, with a GC content of 45%, not utilizing formic acid, and utilizing methyl compounds, it was identified as belonging to the family Methanosarcinaceae.

This strain was confirmed to completely decompose Z into methane and ammonium based on the amount of methane produced.

The effects of testosterone on the contraction and relaxation responses of the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle of the penis to various vasoactive drugs, and on NO in the corpus cavernosum and dorsal nerve of the penis, were investigated using rabbits.

The results suggested that the contractile response of the penile cavernous smooth muscle to α-agonists and the relaxing responses to acetylcholine and VIP are affected by blood testosterone levels.

In particular, it has been shown that α1-adrenergic receptors are primarily involved in the contractile response of the smooth muscle of the penis to castration.

It has also been shown that muscarinic receptors are involved in the castration-induced relaxation of the corpus cavernosum.

NO, a chemical messenger that induces erectile dysfunction, was also found to be affected by testosterone in the corpus cavernosum and dorsal nerve of the penis.

We designed an artificial liver assist device using rat hepatocyte spheroids to replace insufficient metabolism during liver failure.

Spheroids with a diameter of approximately 100 μm were placed into the pores of the polyurethane foam.

Albumin and urea synthesis abilities were higher than those in conventional monolayer cultures and were maintained for up to 26 days.

This system is expected to be useful for artificial liver support.

Several mutants defective in membrane lipid metabolism were isolated using Chinese hamster ovary-derived CHO cells as the parent cell line.

Analysis of this mutant strain revealed the physiological significance of membrane lipids.

We also searched for a gene in the human genome that complements this mutation and cloned it.

Furthermore, we identified genes that are abnormally expressed in rheumatoid arthritis patients, analyzed how they are involved in the pathology, and reported findings on the search for causative genes.

We reported the results of an analysis using the G-banding method to determine the type and frequency of radiation-induced chromosomal abnormalities in cultured lymphocyte chromosomes obtained from 63 Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors.

Cells with stable abnormalities accounted for the majority of abnormal cells , and the frequency of abnormalities increased in a dose - dependent manner .

All stable abnormalities were classified into nine groups: reciprocal translocations, complex translocations, insertions, pericentric inversions, paracentric inversions, terminal deletions, interstitial deletions, and unspecified types.

A statistical analysis of 3370 breaks involved in reciprocal translocations showed a high correlation between the relative DNA content of individual chromosomes and the distribution of the number of chromosome breaks [1994.6].

Basic studies were conducted on lecithin measurement and the optimal conditions for converting lecithin to choline were obtained.

We also determined the optimal conditions for measuring choline and acetylcholine, and for preparing a glucose oxidase-modified electrode.

In an immunosensor using IgG class-specific antibodies, it was found that the optimal incubation time between the antibody electrode and a transferrin solution containing ferrocene-labeled antibody was approximately 15 minutes, and that a gold-antibody electrode was superior.

In vivo sensors could not completely eliminate the effects of interfering substances in the body, and this could not be achieved.

The gene for the named protein (Apo(a)) has four point mutations in the 5&#39; region.

In the 5&#39; region, four types are found in Americans, but only three types are found in Japanese.

The proportion of types in patients with cerebral infarction was the same as in normal individuals, but type D, which has low expression activity, was less prevalent in patients with myocardial infarction.

This is thought to be the reason why blood lipoprotein (a) levels are high in patients with myocardial infarction.

We investigated the effect of ultraviolet (UV-B) irradiation on the ion transport system in red yeast, in which carotenoid synthesis is induced by UV-B irradiation.

As a result, we discovered the phenomenon in which UV-B specifically excreted K+.

The dependence of this effect on light intensity and wavelength was investigated.

The action spectrum for K + efflux had a peak at around 270 nm and showed sensitive wavelength dependence.

He said that the involvement of photoreceptors that absorb around 270 nm is thought to be involved.

This paper describes a method for preparing coated enzymes in which lipase is coated with a surfactant and exhibits enzymatic activity in organic media, and describes reactions using the enzyme in organic solvents, focusing on esterification reactions.

Lipase prepared by coating with a nonionic surfactant in which an oleyl group has been introduced into the hydrophobic part of the molecule shows high enzymatic activity in isooctane.

When compared with powdered enzyme using the esterification of benzyl alcohol and lauric acid as a model reaction, it showed approximately 100 times greater activity.

The effectiveness of surfactant coating was also demonstrated using examples such as the optical resolution of menthol and the transesterification of triglycerides.

There are brain-specific and placenta-specific GHRH genes, which are expressed in different ways.

Somatostatin analogues are used clinically for diagnostic purposes.

Regarding the intracellular signaling mechanism of GH, the significance of tyrosine residues in GHR and Pit1 and the regions of GHR cells required for binding to JAK2 have been investigated.

The metastasis suppressor gene (nm23) was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of acromegaly.

GH and lipid metabolism are also related to body fat and heart disease.

GH secretion is affected by GH releasing peptide, synthetic GH releasing substance hexarelin, etc.

This paper provides an overview of steroid production and metabolism in osteoblasts.

First, the steroid biosynthesis pathway and related enzymes are described, and then the kinetics and inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes in osteoblasts (I), namely 5α-reductase, aromatase, and sulfatase, are explained.

We also described gene I, whose expression was confirmed in osteoblasts.

The mechanism of expression and regulation of I remains to be elucidated.

We investigated the suspension culture medium for the rice variety ``IR 24,&#39;&#39; which is highly adaptable to direct seeding and has a high yield.

The optimum 2,4-D concentration in callus suspension cultures was 4 mg/l.

The addition of aspartic acid and glutamine, which are said to be effective in promoting callus proliferation in Koshihikari, actually had an inhibitory effect in IR24.

It was better not to reduce macronutrient and sucrose concentrations.

Since color perception is highly subjective, it can always be said to be an optical illusion.

In this study, we attempted to engineer color illusions using a mutually inhibitory neural network, focusing on 1) color simultaneous contrast illusions and 2) color appearance illusions.

Specifically, we assume mutual inhibitory dynamics between neurons located within the minimum color space required for color representation.

As a result of computer simulation, for 1) and 2), it was possible to reproduce colors on a computer that showed a tendency similar to the color appearance perceived subjectively by humans.

In order to clarify the mechanism of autoimmune disease development by investigating the biosynthesis mechanism and expression regulation mechanism of HNK-1 carbohydrate antigen, we investigated glucuronyltransferase (GT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of this carbohydrate antigen.

We performed cDNA cloning of GT derived from rat brain and determined the base sequence of the clone and its deduced amino acid sequence.

The results of this comparison indicate the possibility that HNK-1 carbohydrate antigens are also expressed in nematodes and parasites, suggesting that GT is highly conserved phylogenetically.

Furthermore, forced expression of GT cDNA in cultured cells resulted in the induction of HNK-1 carbohydrate antigens on the cell surface.

Furthermore, we were able to isolate the mouse GT gene.

This paper described the institutional structure and organizational cooperation in the Australian beef industry, which has established a high-level beef safety and quality assurance system, focusing on the monitoring function.

The Cattle Care Scheme is an important quality assurance program for Australian beef producers.

It is an externally audited certification system that complies with ISO 9002 and complements HACCP to ensure the supply of safe beef cattle.

Feedlots operating under the National Feedlot Certification System have established manuals for the composition of feed, fattening period, and weight of fattening cattle, and they manage the health of fattening cattle and control production.

A safety assurance system has been established at all stages of distribution.

Another feature of the Australian beef industry&#39;s safety assurance system is that a third-party organization audits the safety assurance efforts of each entity at the distribution stage and after.

Using the resource recycling project in Kunitomi Town, Miyazaki Prefecture, as an example, we evaluated the environmental impact of recycling biomass resources.

For the evaluation, the flow of biomass resources and the generation of environmental loads were combined into a single accounting system.

This system makes it possible to clearly represent the complex flow of biomass resources and clarify the extent of the environmental burden caused by activities.

According to Kunitomi Town&#39;s biomass resource account, the operation of the compost center has reduced nitrogen oxides by 177 tons per year and nitrous oxides by 752 tons per year.

Bluefin tuna, which swim at high speeds, are best farmed in large aquaculture ponds.

In order to design an optimal fish pond that takes into account the effects of tides and waves, we introduced a method for formulating a mechanical computational model to calculate the underwater shape of the net-like structure that constitutes the facility.

In this model, the mesh is assumed to consist of multiple masses and springs, with mass concentrated at the nodes and the masses connected to springs whose mass can be neglected.

Using this calculation model, the underwater shape and acting load of a large bluefin tuna farming pond were calculated for several flow conditions, and the weather resistance of the facility was evaluated.

In the future, we would like to calculate what kind of movements, deformations, and forces act on the entire fish pond mooring system.

Since damage to Aomori Todomatsu trees caused by Tengu&#39;s broom disease was frequently observed around the Shirasuna Marsh from Lake Oze to Mihari, six survey trees were set up specifically in the Shirasuna area and changes in the condition of the disease were visually observed.

A report from 2006 showed that the lesion had grown from 10 cm x 15 cm in 2004 to 30 cm x 35 cm.

There was no other indication that the lesions were affecting tree vigor.

It is also necessary to investigate the distance from the boardwalk to see its relationship with the natural environment of the site and with human impacts.

In Japan, systems and policies for environmentally friendly agriculture have been developed, but at the same time, economic viability is also important.

In this paper, we examine whether agricultural products produced using environmentally friendly agriculture can establish their own market and what kind of labeling and certification system is necessary for this, looking at the efforts being made in European countries.

In particular, we looked at Switzerland&#39;s Integrated Production (IP) and EUREPGAP.

In environmental conservation-based agriculture, the social establishment of production standards and labeling/certification systems is of great significance, and it has been shown that products that are evaluated as environmentally friendly will be given a price premium through the market.

Oike Research &amp; Development&#39;s &quot;MOS&quot; is a material in which silicon oxide is deposited to a thickness of 30 to 80 nm on a 12 μm thick PET film by vacuum deposition.

There are MOS-TB (for boiling and general use) and MOS-TR (for retort use).

One processing point to note is that silicon oxide films are easily damaged, so to produce composite materials, another film is first vapor-deposited onto the silicon oxide surface.

In addition, the authors recommended that dry lamination be the preferred lamination method.

The medium composition and species selection for Lyophyllum decastes were investigated.

Among 13 types of media with different combinations of medium materials, the ratio of sawdust, corn cob, oregano, and rice bran in a ratio of 4:4:4:2 (or 1) gave the largest mycelium diameter.

Coniferous sawdust was better than broadleaf sawdust.

In the selection of fungal species, the morphology of fruit bodies and yields were different among the seven strains, but it was thought that a wide-mouthed bottle with a large diameter was more suitable for cultivating Hatakeshimeji [1993.7].

The Sudos sprayer is a necessary machine for growing fruits, including apples, but there has been a problem with the operator being exposed to pesticide solutions while spraying the pesticides.

To address this issue, they developed an unmanned, cable-guided fruit tree pest control robot.

An auxiliary remote control device, located at a location away from the unmanned pest control robot, starts and stops the machine, starts and stops the blower, and starts and stops the spraying of chemicals.

Equipped with safety devices such as an automatic stop device for driving and spraying when an obstacle is detected, and an automatic stop device for the engine when an obstacle is contacted

In Hokkaido, where there is a growing demand for homes with high insulation and airtightness, windows, which are openings, also need to be highly insulated, condensation-proof, airtight, watertight, and wind-resistant.

We have developed a wooden sash that meets these performance requirements.

They achieved their goal by devising a &quot;mechanism for pressing fittings together using pins and tapers&quot; and creating a sliding window.

The double-glazed windows have aluminum frames on the outside and wooden frames on the inside.

The aim of this study was to develop all-male production techniques and breed for superior traits in tilapia, where males grow faster.

Addition of estrone to the diet resulted in a female ratio of 95.6% for T. nilotica.

In a first cleavage inhibition gynogenesis induction test using T. nilotica and T. aurea, a 4-minute heating treatment tended to result in a higher hatching rate.

Furthermore, the success of the induction of gynogenesis was examined by the determination of sex-reversed females and by isozyme analysis.

We have developed and are currently prototyping a circulating dryer that can dry grains such as rice and wheat at a speed of 0.4% or more by utilizing far-infrared rays emitted by heating a far-infrared radiator and the residual heat from the radiator.

The far-infrared emitter is made by coating a far-infrared emitting material on a base material such as stainless steel, and is U-shaped to reduce energy unevenness.

The radiator is heated by burning kerosene.

The design conditions were: loading amount 2000 kg, drying rate 0.6%/h, radiator surface temperature 330°C.

This report summarizes the research findings of Haseyama Toshiro and Chiba Etsuko of the Department of Administrative Sociology at Fukushima University on &quot;Community Center Activities and Local Vitality in Mountainous and Hilly Areas.&quot;

In the final chapter, he proposed &quot;Measures to improve regional vitality in mountainous and hilly areas&quot; (September 1995).

In developing lignin utilization , we investigated the synthesis of phenolic lignin derivatives using a phase separation reaction system and the creation of functional recycled composites in combination with cellulose fibers .

Lignin cresol was synthesized by adding p - cresol and sulfuric acid to defatted wood powder from black pine and maple, and extracting it with acetone.

A fiber mold made from recycled paper was immersed in a lignin cresol solution and welded to create a composite, which was then heated and subjected to a thermal melting process to examine its functionality.

As a result, the composite had high strength properties, excellent hydrophobicity and dimensional stability.

Furthermore, the composite components can be separated and recovered by simple solvent treatment.

This document reported the results of a study on the impact that the poor performance of agricultural management caused by cold damage to rice crops in Hokkaido and Tohoku in 1993 had on the tendency to cut down forest land.
