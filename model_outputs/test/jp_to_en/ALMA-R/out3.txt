Later, Tōkyō no Shōkaku revived the Great Hara Declaration.

Zhang Zhi built a new musical theory based on the latest trends.

It has no central core, and the current Taisho declaration inherits it.

The statement of the Rinzai school of Shingon Buddhism, the Jodo school, and the Jodo Shinshu school is part of the system of the Tendai declaration.

The Shingon declaration was based on what Kukai taught, and is the basis for what has come to be today.

Until the Kamakura period, there were many schools, but they were consolidated into four schools (Hon-sōgō-in, Shin-sōgō-in, Gyōzō-in, and Nakagawa Daisuke-in) by Kōgen-no-ō, the head of the Kōgen sect.

The statement of the True Pure Land School of Koyasan declined and disappeared during the Edo period.

The Hōjō school and the New Hōjō school, as well as the Shingon school, were extinct by the middle of the Meiji period.

Now, Chisan (Chizan) Declaration (Kyoto, Chizan-in), Banzai (Banzai) Declaration (Nara, Tendai-ji), and Nanzan Shinryuu (Nanzen-ji, Kyoto; Kongoji, Kyoto; Koyasan, Koyasan) are respectively classified as Chisan, Banzai, and Nanzan.

The statements of Shingon Shonin and Tosan Shonin (New Shingon True Faith Sect) and the statements of Shingon Shonin and Tosan Shonin (New Shingon True Faith Sect) were originally based on the teachings of Nakagawa Taisho.

Later, it was given the name "Nanshan" as a synonym for Mt. Koya, and was referred to as the "Nanshan inflow".

They are also referred to as "inflow" and "wild mountain inflow".

The music of the pentatonic scale, the pentatonic lament, folk songs, and Jōryūgane can be said to be a transformation of the statement.

The influence of monophonic music is greater than that of polyphonic music.

Emperor Tenchi Tenno (天智天皇/天 じ てんのう).

Men.

From Emperor Nihongo's 34th year (626) to Emperor Tenji's 10th year, December 3, 672 (January 7, 672).

The 38th Emperor.

The name of the national style is Tenmei Hirakasu Mikoto / Amatsumi Mikoto (meaning "Mikoto of the Tenmei Hirakasu national style" or "Mikoto of the Amatsumi national style").

His given name is Kazuki (Kazuraki / Katsuragi).

It is believed that he was called Katsuraki no Miyako before his death.

"Daibō" means the Crown Prince in Japanese, and "Chūdaibō" means "the next Crown Prince" in the language.

Overview

The second son of Emperor Shōmu.

The mother was the Princess Takamado (later Emperor Go-Toba).

The Empress was the daughter of the elder brother of the Emperor and the older brother of the Crown Prince.

Chūnzǐ Chāngzǐ and his co-conspirators plotted a coup d'état to assassinate Sūgō Inukami and install his uncle, Emperor Hirohito, as the new emperor, and Chūnzǐ himself became the crown prince.

And he established the era name Daihōtei and carried out various reforms (Daihōtei's central figure in the reforms of Dōmyō).

He also imprisoned the forces that seemed to be preparing a coup d'état, such as Prince Omiya, and sentenced them to death.

Because Baekje was annihilated by Tang and Silla in 660, the Baekje princes who were staying at the court were sent back, and efforts were made to revive Baekje.

In order to command the Baiyue rescue operations, he stayed in Chikuzen (present-day Fukuoka Prefecture), but in 661, Emperor Tenmu abdicated (died).

After that, he ruled for a long time as emperor without claiming the throne, but after suffering a defeat at the Battle of Iwakura in 663, he moved the capital to Otsu City and was crowned there.

After the Battle of Hakusuiri, he set up water castles and fire towers and other defensive facilities as part of the nation's land defense policy.

In addition, they have been carrying out reforms such as institutional reform from the 19th to the 26th grades up to that point.

Furthermore, in 670, I asked them to create the oldest national census in Japan, the "Kyōwa-nenshi," which is the oldest national census in the country.

Emperor Tenji wanted to pass the throne to his first son and prince Uda, according to the Nihon Shoki.

However, after the rebellion that broke out after the death of Tenji, Emperor Tenmu, who was the son of the Great Kai Emperor, defeated the Emperor Otsu and ascended the throne.

The emperor of the Tennō and Tenmō systems continued until the reign of Seiwa Tennō.

After the death of Teitoku, the grandson of Taishi, the White Wall King, ascended the throne as Emperor Genrinyu, and from then on, the Taishi system was established.

It is said that he sent his four daughters as concubines to the Daikoku Emperor because he had taken the Daitō King from the Daikoku Emperor. This was done in order to atone for his sins.

Biography

Nihon Genji was born in 626 (Genji 34 years)

On June 14, 4th year, 645th day, June 12, 645th year - Crown Prince ascended the throne.

Shimmu died on July 24, 761 (August 24, 661 BCE). He was posthumously deified.

Tenji became the emperor on January 3, 701 (February 20, 668 BCE).

He died on December 3, 1010 (January 7, 672) at the age of 46.

Japanese: （ 『 扶桑 略記 』 で は 病死 説 の 後 一説 と し て 「 一 云 天皇 駕 馬幸 山階 鄕更 無 還御 永交 山林 不知 崩 所 只 以 履 沓 落處 爲 其 山陵 以往 諸 皇 不知 因果 恒 事 殺害 」 と あ り 山中 で 行方 不明 に な っ た と さ れ ている 。

The fact that Emperor Tenji did not ascend the throne for a long time is a mystery in the political history of the middle of the 7th century.

There are several theories about this that are being discussed.

Consideration for the forces pushing for the deification of Tenmu Tennō.

Japanese: 即ち 、 従来 定説 と さ れ て き た 、 天武 天皇 は 天智 天皇 の 弟 で あ る と い う の は 誤り で 、 皇極 天皇 が 舒明 天皇 と 結婚 する 前 に 生 ん だ 漢 皇子 で あ り 、 彼 は 天智 天皇 の 異父 兄 で あ る と する 説 に 基づ く もの で あ る 。

Indeed, if we calculate the age of the Emperor Tenmu, who is recorded in the "Nihonsoki" and some historical books, based on the age of Emperor Tenji, who is recorded in the "Nihonsoki" and some historical books, and then reverse-calculate his birth year based on the age of Emperor Tenji, then Emperor Tenmu would become older.

However, there is no contradiction between the same sources, and there are many sources with an age difference of 8 to 9 years.

Japanese: これ に 対 し て は 『 「 父親 が 違 う と は いえ 、 兄 を 差し置 い て 弟 が 」 と い う こと で は 体裁 が 悪 い の で 、 意図 的 に 天智 の 年齢 を 引き上げ た の だ 』 と の 主張 が あ る が 、 『 「 日本 書紀 」 に 見え る 、 天智 の 年齢 16 歳 と いう 記 述 は 虚 偽 で あ る 」 と の 主張 も あ り ます 。

Therefore, the true year of birth is 614, which is used by the likes of Sōshun Sōryōki and others.

In response to this argument, "In ancient times, it was not uncommon for there to be vacancies (in fact, during the reigns of Tennō Tenji and Shōtoku, who preceded and followed Tennō Temmu, there were also vacancies, and they did not immediately ascend the throne)."

This was due to an error in the calculation.

There are also opinions that other historical books, such as the "Nihon Shoki" and those that are referred to as "Kojiki", which were compiled at different times and have different characteristics, cannot be treated in the same way.

(Also refer to the "Age of Emperor Tenmu" section)

The Meiji Restoration was a coup d'état led by the light prince (Taishō Tennō), and the middle brother prince is said to have lost his position.

Recently, the relationship between Zhongdai and the Crown Prince of Suiwu has been relatively good, and their basic policies are also similar. This has been pointed out.

If that were the case, the motive for the Crown Prince Imperial to kill the deer would disappear.

Also, due to the recognition of tampering with the description of the Great Change in the Nihon Shoki, this theory has become widespread.

In addition, according to this theory, the reasons for the abdication of Emperor Hirohito and the expulsion of the Soga clan after the coup d'etat are also explained, so it is attracting attention for being able to explain other doubts as well.

The theory that the postponement of his accession to the throne was due to opposition to his relationship with women.

This is said to be a song that hints at the adulterous relationship between Hirohito Emperor and Empress Konoe (the same-sister daughter of Tenchi), who was the wife of Hirohito Emperor, recorded in the Nihonshoki (Japanese Annals).

Japanese: 異母 兄弟 姉妹 間 で の 恋愛 ・ 婚姻 は 許 さ れ る が 、 同母 兄弟 姉妹 間 で の それ は 許 さ れ な かっ た の が 当時 の 人々 の 恋愛 事情 だっ た が 、 里中 満智子 作 の 天上 の 虹 で は 実際 に 関係 が あ っ た 解釈 が な さ れ 、 その 恋愛 事情 の 背 景 と して 描 か れ ています 。

It is said that the daughter of the intermediary emperor took the throne as the consort of the previous emperor after the death of Emperor Seiwa, but for some reason the records were erased.

This is derived from the interpretation of "Middle Emperor's Order" in the Man'yōshū, in which the character of "Middle Emperor's Order" is said to be an intermediary between the Empress and the Emperor. It is claimed that "Middle Emperor's Order" refers to an emperor who was the intermediary between the Empress and the Emperor, and that it can be interpreted as such.

If the Empress Kōgō = "Middle Emperor's Command" was called in this way, then why was it necessary for her to be called in this way? It is possible to speculate about this, but there is no definite proof. It is also possible to assume that the Empress Kōgō = "Middle Emperor's Command" was called in this way, but there is no definite proof. It is also possible to assume that the Empress Kōgō = "Middle Emperor's Command" was called in this way, but there is no definite proof.

It is also possible to assume that the Empress Kōgō = "Middle Emperor's Command" was called in this way, but there is no definite proof. It is also possible to assume that the

There are various constraints such as the nature and sources of political history and archaeological findings, and it is difficult to prove them, but there are prospects for the progress of research in the future, including the coordination with archaeological findings.

Song

He was also a man who passed on four songs from the Man'yōshū to the Man'yōshū poet.

Even if it is sung by 100 people, the respect for the founder of the Heian Dynasty is expressed in it, and the following song is written at the beginning of it.

The fields of autumn are covered with kariho no ihono, a coarse material, and my hands, which are wet from the dew, are covered with my own clothes.

Here is a poem from the Man'yōshū:

Kōgū (ca. 700 BCE) is said to have loved the scent of incense more than anything else, and to have quarreled with his ears over it, and to have fought with his thighs over it as well.

The Saiō-ji temple belongs to the Fujiwara clan, a court family descended from the Fujiwara clan.

The Fujiwara clan belongs to the Fujiwara northern branch of the Hokke lineage, and their status is that of the Seiwa clan.

The Dōjō-in family and the Imadegawa family (Kokyō-in family) are branches of the Saigō-ji family.

Furthermore, the name of the temple in Yokogawa is used by a powerful branch of the warrior clan of Iyo, namely the Yokogawa clan of Iyo.

The family crest uses the three-leafed bar.

The Shingon temple family is descended from Fujiwara no Tadamichi, the third son of Fujiwara no Nobuyori.

Japanese: 通季 の 曾孫 西園寺 公経 の とき 、 源 頼朝 の 姪 を 妻 と し て い た こと から 承久 の 乱 に 際 し て 鎌倉 幕府 の 縁者 と し て 警戒 さ れ て 朝廷 に 幽閉 さ れ 、 かえって 乱後 に 幕府 の 信任 を 受け て 関東 申次 と なっ た 。

The name of the temple's family name is derived from the name of the temple built by Kōkei in Kyoto (Kyōto Prefecture, Kaga-no-kuni, Nishiyama-sō).

This hall is also known by the alternate name of Kitayama-den, and the current Kinkaku-ji temple was built on this land by Yoshimitsu Minamoto, who received it from the West Garden Temple family.

Since the Genpei War, the Kamakura shogunate has received support from the Minamoto clan, and throughout the Kamakura period, the Minamoto clan has maintained a powerful presence.

Yoshikuni Yoshikane came close to the Daikokuji clan and arranged for his daughter to be married to Emperor Go-Toba and Emperor Go-Shirakawa.

However, after his son Kōhei Saigō took over, the Tendō clan began to distance itself from the shogunate, and this time they supported the Higashiyama clan in opposing the Tendō clan, deepening their conflict with the Tendō clan.

After that, the Heian-kyo Genji clan was destroyed, and the shogunate of Kamakura was abolished, and Kanto Shinji was dismissed from his post.

Japanese: 公宗 は 北条 氏 の 残党 で あ る 北条 泰家 ( 時興 ) を 匿 い 、 建武 の 新政 を 開始 し た 後 醍醐 天皇 を 暗殺 し 、 持明 院 統 の 後 伏見 上皇 を 擁立 する 謀叛 を 計画 し 、 弟 の 西園寺 公重 の 密告 で 計画 が 露見 し た 事 に よ り 公宗 は 逃亡 し 、 後 醍醐 天皇 は 暗殺 され 、 持明 院 統 の 後 伏見 上皇 は 暗殺 され 、 北条 泰家 ( 時興 ) は 暗殺 され 、 北条 氏 は 滅亡 し 、 北条 泰家 ( 時興 ) の 残党 は 建武 の 新政 を 継承 し 、 北条 氏 の 残党 は 北条 泰家 ( 時興 ) の 残党 と

During the Meiji Restoration, Taejun Yokoyama, a member of the same Tenryu family, was adopted as a son by the West Garden Temple, and went on to become a political figure, serving as Prime Minister and other high-ranking posts, and exerting influence in the political scene of the Taisho and Showa eras as an elder statesman.

Japanese: ちなみ に 公望 は 、 西園 寺 家 の 家業 で あ る 筈 の 琵琶 の 演奏 が 苦手 で あ っ た が 、 首相 在任 中 に 明治 天皇 から 悪戯 半分 に 「 久し ぶり に 西園 寺 家 の 琵琶 が 聞 き た い 」 と 言 わ れ 、 宮内省 の 雅楽 寮 の 職員 と 琵琶 の 演奏 を し て い た 琵琶 家 の 後 継 者 に 「 琵琶 の 演奏 を 継 承 し て く ださ い 」 と 勧誘 され た こと が あ った 。

Hieizan (Hieizan) is a mountain that extends from the western part of Otsu City in Shiga Prefecture to the northeastern part of Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture.

Daishozan (848.3 m) and Shimegatake (838 m), two peaks located on the border between Shiga Prefecture and Kyoto City's Kyogoku Ward, are collectively referred to as Daisenkyo.

Summary

It is also possible to be located in the northeast of Kyoto, which is near the Gate of Ghosts, and Mount Hiei is considered to be a mountain that protects the royal castle.

In the Kojiki, Mount Hiei is recorded as Mount Hiyono-yama (ヒエノのやま), and it is said that the deity Daisho-kami resides in Mount Hiyono-yama in Nara Prefecture, and that the Kongo is his sacred body.

Since the Enryaku-ji Temple was established in Yoshino Mountain, Taisho-ji and Enryaku-ji became the guardian deities of the Taitsu sect and the deity of Yoshino Mountain, respectively. As a result, the worship of the mountain king began to spread in relation to Taisho-ji and Enryaku-ji.

In addition to visiting the shrines at the summit of Mt. Hiei and the shrine at the foot of Mt. Yoshino, it is also possible to walk the 1,000-day pilgrimage route through faith-filled Mt. Hiei.

Climbing is also popular, and some representative climbing routes include the Unmono-saka from Kyoto's Sakyo Ward, Kyoto University, and the Momotani Pass in Shiga Prefecture, as well as the route through Momotani Valley from Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture.

The Obsidian Hill is an ancient road that monks and soldiers of the court, as well as envoys, traveled back and forth between Kyoto and Enryaku-ji Temple, and it is still a popular hiking trail today.

There are roads and cable cars, ropeways that allow you to reach the peak on weekends, so many tourists visit on weekends.

There used to be a theme park and a ski resort at the top of Mt. Hiei, but all of them were closed by 2002, and the ski resort's site has become the Garden Museum Hieizan and the site of Mt. Hiei's summit amusement park has become the Garden Museum Hieizan.

According to the survey results of the Geographical Institute of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the eastern peak is called Daibutsu and the western peak is called Shiomine-yama, and they are collectively referred to as Mt. Bishamon.

In "Ton no Ki", the name of the trigonometric point located at the top of the East is "Mount Hiei".

This triangular point is located in the border between Osaka City and Kyoto City, but as its location, it belongs to Osaka City.

When looking at Mount Yoshino from the Kinki Basin, it is difficult to confirm the peak of Mt. Yoshino, and it is possible to think that Mount Shiomi is the peak of Mt. Yoshino when looking at Mount Shiomi from the Kinki Basin.

At the Kyufu Electric Railway Kumanoyama Ropeway in Kumanoyama, Kyufu Electric Railway, the peak of Yoshino Mountain is set as Kumanoyama Station, the top station of Mt. Yoshino.

He also wrote works such as "The Tale of Genji" and "The Tale of Murasaki Shikibu".

As the twin peaks of medieval literature that compare to "The Tale of Genji," they had a great influence on Noh theater, haiku poetry, and the "Heike Monogatari" (Tales of the Heike).

The "Tendo Monogatari" by Kōan Myōō and "Tonari Monogatari" by Gyokudō Kanboku, along with the "Three Great Lists of History and Satire," are collectively referred to as the "Three Great Lists of History and Satire."

It is extremely unique in terms of its format, and there are some similarities to the "Yushan Zazhuan" compiled by the poet Li Shangyuan (alias Yushan) of the Tang Dynasty, which can be pointed out. However, there are no other similar books.

Japanese: 巻末 の 跋文 に よ れ ば 、 執筆 の 動機 および 命名 の 由来 は 、 内 大臣 藤原 伊周 が 妹 中宮 藤原 定子 と 一条 天皇 に 当時 まだ 高価 だっ た 料紙 を 献上 し た 時 、 「 帝 の 方 は 『 史記 』 を 書写 なさ っ た が 、 こちら は 如何に 」 と い う 宮 の 下問 に 対 し 、 伊周 が 答 え は 『 『 史記 』 を 書写 し て います 』 と 答 え は 『 『 史記 』 を 書写 し て います 』 と 答 え は 『 『 史記 』 を 書写 し て います 』 と 答 え は 『 『 史記 』 を 書写 し て います 』 と 答 え は 『 『 史記 』 を 書写 し て います 』 と 答 え は 『 『 史記

And that is due to the fact that he was granted paper from the Imperial Palace as a reward for his service. (There is no corresponding article in the three-volume set, but there is none in the Nihon Ryōiki, the Nihon Ryōiki Manuscript, the Nihon Ryōiki Complete Manuscript, the Kinosaki Manuscript, and the Maeda Manuscript, all of which are related to the Nihon Ryōiki.)

The name of the "pillow grass" is said to come from there, according to popular belief.

According to Lin Hwabi-ko's "Study of the Kakushi", he cites researchers such as those who have studied Kakushi's self-portraits and those who have studied Kakushi's past and those who have studied Kakushi's contemporaries, including Kikuchi Kankei, Ikeda Kakushi, and Kitagawa Kakushi.

Next, I will discuss the meaning of the pillow in a representative manner.

Beds and bedding are referred to as "shiki" (from Shoku Nihongi to Shikibuton), which is based on the word "shiki" (from Shoku Nihongi to Shikibuton).

The author says that chapters with lists of song lyrics, quotations, and terms are common in encyclopedias, because there are many such chapters.

The Memorandum Book says: The Memorandum Book should also be placed on the pillowcase, which means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means

The Treasury Sutra says

The "no relation" theory

However, there is still no consensus on this.

Also, the beautiful Kasa-ne color was described in "Hana no Naka no Hana no Uta" using the common noun "Makusa-gusa," which is used to refer to a pillow.

The first draft was established around the same time as the preface, according to the same text, around the 10th year of Chōtoku (996), when the left general officer Genkei Yoshifuji took it out of the author's house and spread it throughout the world.

After that, it was constantly revised and there are some documents written around the late Heian period that are believed to have been written by him.

The original text of "The Tale of Genji," which is cited in the "Genji Monogatari Emaki," contains passages that do not exist in extant copies, suggesting a complex process of formation.

The differences between the editions are enormous.

It consists of three volumes in the form of miscellanies.

Manuscripts bearing the seals of the person thought to be Fujiwara no Teika and Fujiwara no Yukinaga, who ruled in 1228 (Antei 2nd year), with the seals of the person thought to be Fujiwara no Teika and Fujiwara no Yukinaga, who ruled in 1228 (Antei 2nd year), with the seals of the person thought to be Fujiwara no Teika and Fujiwara no Yukinaga, who ruled in 1228 (Antei 2nd year), with the seals of the person thought to be Fujiwara no Teika and Fujiwara no Yukinaga, who ruled in 1228 (Antei 2nd year), with the seals of the person thought to be Fujiwara no Teika and Fuji

"Waniyaka ni Ajayaka" is easy to interpret and is considered to be the most ancient in appearance.

Furthermore, it was differentiated into two types by Ikeda Kamekichi.

Class I (Class A) - The first 70 chapters, beginning with "Spring is Dawn," have been lost, and the text begins with "Kokuchiyoge na Mono."

230 episodes.

Yōmei Wenku Zangben, Kokutōshitsu Shiryōbu Toshokan Zangben, and Kōshō-gū Shiryōbu Toshokan Zangben, as well as the Kōshō-gū Shiryōbu Toshokan Zangben held at the Kōshō-gū Shiryōbu Toshokan.

Class 2 (E class) - 300 episodes.

Myōfu, Mō-ūnga, Kōshōkan, Gakuyō-kan, Itadake-no-sōshitsu, Kōshōji-no-sōshitsu, Chūyū-no-sōshitsu, Aikaho-no-sōshitsu, and Kōshōdō-no-bunkan.

The system related to the monk Nyoin, who was related to the Fujiwara clan through marriage, is said to have been related to the transmission of the Genji monk (one of his sisters was the consort of Minamoto no Takakuni, the son of Genji).

It can be traced back to the late Heian period.

The outcome of the good-copy debate between the three-volume set and the Nihon shoki has become almost a consensus: that the Nihon shoki is the source of inferior copies.

Excluding the first 70 episodes, there are 230 episodes in total.

300th episode

They take the form of classifications.

A copy of the manuscript from the Muromachi period.

5 Volumes Lost?

They take the form of a classified index.

There is only the Kaga House Testament and the Hideyoshi Toyotomi House Testament (in the possession of the Hideyoshi Toyotomi Association), which were passed down from the Kaga House and the Hideyoshi Toyotomi House, respectively.

The box of Kin Kanme is inside it, and inside the box is an inlay of gold depicting "The Tale of Genji Sleeping Mat" written on it.

They are important cultural assets.

It is believed to be the oldest manuscript in the "Kotobuki" copy of the "Makura-sōshi" written in the early Kamakura period.

Among these, the Hokkō Gen'yō-in Hōjō is included in both the Gunkan-shūkyū and the Shinkō Gen'yō-in Hōjō in the upper and lower volumes respectively, while the three Hokkō Gen'yō-in Hōjō are included in the Shinkō Gen'yō-in Hōjō in the new edition.

Furthermore, because the original Nohonbun was used as the base text in early printed editions of the Edo period (the years of Kanei), it became the mainstream of transmitted texts until modern times in the form of commentaries such as Mushakushi Bunko Hanazono and Mushakushi Bunko Haruzono (annotated by Noriyuki Kitayama).

However, by the time it was 1946 (Showa 21), it was re-evaluated by Tanaka Chigorō (1917-1987), and after the Second World War, only his works were published and used in textbooks.

In addition, it is suspected that the three-volume Heike monogatari was used in the articles of the Man'yoshu, which is believed to have been created in the late Heian period. The seven-part scroll-painting Emakimonogatari also survives.

The three-volume second edition has over 300 independent chapters.

Japanese: 「 虫 は 」 「 木 の 花 は 」 「 すさまじ きもの 」 「 うつくし きもの 」 に 代表 さ れ る 「 もの は づくし 」 の 「 類聚 章段 」 を はじめ 、 日常 生活 や 四季 の 自然 を 観察 し た 「 随想 章段 」 、 作者 が 出仕 し た 定子 皇后 周辺 の 宮廷 社会 を 振り返り し 、 その 背後 に 隠され ている 「 秘密 」 を 探す 「 秘辛 章段 」 、 「 秘辛 章段 」 に 続く 「 随想 章段 」 に 続く 「 随想 章段 」 に 続く 「 随想 章段 」 に 続く 「 随想 章段 」 に 続く 「 随想 章段 」 に 続く 「 随想 章段 」 に 続く 「 随想

On the other hand, there are chapters that are ambiguous in terms of classification (for example, the first chapter "Spring is Dawn" in the first section is classified as a descriptive chapter, but there are objections to this as well).

Japanese: 平仮名 を 駆使 し た 和文 の 簡潔 な 口語 体 で 書 か れ 、 総じて 軽妙 な 筆致 の 短編 が 多 い が 、 中関白 家 の 没落 と 主君 ・ 定子 皇后 の 身 に ふりかか っ た 不幸 を 反映 し て 、 時 に かすか な 感傷 が 交じ っ た 心情 の 吐露 も あ る 。

When analyzing low-carbon steel samples using the pyroelectric infrared absorption method, the carbon content varies depending on the standard samples used for calibration, so the analysis values / certification values may fluctuate.

Japanese: 炭素 濃度 が 高 い 鉄鋼 標準 物質 （ ＪＳＳ ５７ ‐ ６ ／ Ｃ ： ０ ． ５２ ％ ） と 低 い 鉄鋼 標準 物質 （ ＪＳＳ １２０３ ‐ ２ ／ Ｃ ： ０ ． ００９６ ％ ） を 用い て 、 鉄鋼 の 炭素 濃度 を 測定 し た 。

The analysis values for high concentrations deviated significantly from the true values, while those for low concentrations tended to be closer to the true values.

By using low concentrations of the standard, we were able to analyze a sample with extremely low carbon content and obtain good results in terms of both concentration and reproducibility.

The effect of the supercritical CO2 produced by the perfluoroethyl methacrylate (PFMA) block copolymer (PS-PFMA) on the nanobubbles formed during the expansion molding using CO2 saturation pressure was investigated.

Japanese: 連続 アニオン 重合 で 合成 し た ＰＳ ‐ ＰＦＭＡ の 薄膜 を ６０ ℃ ， ＣＯ２ 飽和 圧 ７ ． ５ 〜 ３０ ＭＰａ で １ ｈ アニール し た 後 ， ０ ℃ ， ０ ． ５ ＭＰａ／ｍｉｎ で １ ｈ Ａｎｉｏｌ し て ２０ ｍｉｎ／ｍｉｎ で １ ｈ Ａｎｉｏｌ し て ２０ ｍｉｎ／ｍｉｎ で １ ｈ Ａｎｉｏｌ し て ２０ ｍｉｎ／ｍｉｎ で １ ｈ Ａｎｉｏｌ し て ２

As a result, CO2 exists in the 10 nm order of spherical PFMAs in the C2H5OH domain, so the PFMA domain serves as a template for the formation of foam bodies.

The average diameter of the bubbles in the foam cell is 10 to 30 nm, and it increases up to 20 MPa, after which it decreases.

In the measurement of elipsometric parameters before and after bubble formation in PS-PFMA, CO2 pressure increased, and the refractive index decreased, while the volume fraction of the bubble cells increased.

Ethanol / Cyclohexane 2 components in a liquid were formed by hydrogen bonding on the surface of glass spheres by using a 1 H-NMR method to investigate the "Ethanol Macro Clusters".

The chemical shift of protons in ethanol / deuterated cyclohexane 2 components in a solution of glass spheres in ethanol / deuterated cyclohexane 2 was mainly measured in the case where ethanol and deuterated cyclohexane 2 were present, and in the case where ethanol and deuterated cyclohexane 2 were not present. The chemical shift of protons in ethanol / deuterated cyclohexane 2 components in a solution of glass spheres in ethanol / deuterated cyclohexane 2 was mainly measured in the case where ethanol and deuterated cyclohexane 2 were present, and in the case where ethanol and deuterated cyclohexane 2 were not present.

From this, it is suggested that two types of ethanol clusters exist in ethanol with high concentrations, and that ethanol molecules are exchanged between the surface and bulk clusters.

As part of the development of catalysts of the homogeneous equilibrium type, various rules-based silicates were fixed with organic bases to create inorganic-organic hybrid catalysts, and their catalytic properties were investigated.

Here, we have investigated the post-synthesis processing and organic base modification of MCM-22 (MWW) in the borosilicate type.

Japanese: ＭＷＷ は ， 独立 し た ２ 種類 の ２ 次元 １０ 員 環 細孔 と １２ 員 環 スーパー ケージ を 持 つ ゼオライト で ， 結晶 化 直後 の 生成 物 は 層状 前駆 体 を 形成 し ， 焼成 する と ＭＷＷ 構造 が 生成 し ， これ が 層状 前駆 体 の 形成 に 繋がる ２ 次元 １０ 員 環 細孔 と １２ 員 環 スーパー ケージ の 形成 に 繋がる ２ 次元 １０ 員 環 細孔 と １２ 員 環 スーパー ケージ の 形成 に 繋がる ２ 次元 １０ 員 環 細孔 と １２ 員 環 スーパー ケージ

The pocket area was thought to be the site of the bonding of organic bases, which would allow for the reaction of large substrates.

In addition, by increasing the surface area by peeling off the layers, and by converting it into particles, it is possible to expect the high-performanceization of a single layer of this catalyst.

By using ammonium chloride of grade 4 as ionic liquid, it was possible to synthesize urethane using cyclic amine.

However, when ethyl methyl imidazolium tetrafluoro borate ethane and trifluoro methyl sulfonyl imide ene were used, the cyclic urethane yield was only 0 to 16%.

Pressure sensitivity was at its highest when the yield and selectivity were 10 MPa at 10 MPa.

Even when only supercritical carbon dioxide was used, the same trend was observed, and the reaction mechanism was also assumed to be the same.

As a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons, we have studied the development of a new generation of fluorocarbon compounds that do not damage the ozone layer and have little impact on global warming.

Japanese: ５ 員 環 構造 を 有 する 独創 的 な ２ 種類 の ふっ 素 系 化合 物 （ 半 導体 製造 用 ドライ エッチング 用途 の オクタフルオロ シクロペンテン および 精密 洗浄 溶剤 用途 の ヘプタ フルオロ シクロペンタン ） の 実用 化 と その 製造 技術 開発 に 取り組む 。

These compounds do not possess the ozone-depleting power, and their impact on global warming is small. This is their characteristic feature: they do not possess the ozone-depleting power, and their impact on global warming is small.

The characteristic of this technology is that it has achieved both environmental suitability and high performance by using a unique molecular design.

They have high performance due to the use of new and unique molecular structures that take advantage of the characteristics of the 5-member ring, which is appropriate for the frontier fields.

To determine the fiber content, quality / length, radius, and density of the "chirogel" network of fibrinoid gels induced by low temperatures, the turbidity at 400-800 nm wavelengths was measured at 2 °C.

Fibronogenic cells aggregate into fibronogenic fibers, which form a structure that is thicker and more elastic than troponin-induced fibrin fibers.

In addition, the effects of glucose, mannose and dextran additives were investigated.

Gelation at low temperatures was delayed with the addition of glucose and mannose, and a spatially different effect was observed.

On the other hand, gelation at low temperatures is promoted by the addition of dekstrane, and its effect increases as the molecular weight of dekstrane is increased.

The results obtained from these cryogels are consistent with those obtained from fibrin gel induced by trombin, which makes them useful for elucidating the mechanism of gelation at low temperatures.

The latest progress in the selective synthesis of third-generation alcohols was introduced.

We reported on the precise observation and theoretical modeling of the hardening process for the purpose of improving the processing accuracy of the molding process for optical shapes.

To study the growth process of the smallest hardening units, I observed the exposure time of ultraviolet light by changing it.

In this case, the intensity of the light does not change along the direction of travel, so the incident light is used as a parallel beam.

From experimental and theoretical studies, the growth process became clear, and a simulation method for the hardening growth process was established.

We developed a new type of color-recording material based on a color-mixing film matrix composed of high-molecular-weight polymers, and conducted research on its recording principle and dynamic recording characteristics.

I showed a near-field color photograph of colloidal monocrystalline silica particles (diameter 103 nm) dispersed in a plate-type quartz cell (optical path length = 10 mm) in a plate-type quartz cell (optical path length = 10 mm), and explained it.

Crystal structures always appear as a result of extremely simple principles that reduce the possibility of dead space to the minimum.

When the effective diameter (Deff) of the particles and the electric double layer included in them are related by D ≤ Deff, the particles only vibrate at equilibrium positions and crystallize.

The elasticity, viscosity, and field response of the colloidal crystal system are described with respect to these properties.

If analysis of markers is possible directly, conventional absorption analysis methods and turbidity analysis methods can be simplified in terms of operation.

In this paper, six types of organic reagents, such as sodium acetate, acetic acid, etc., were added to salt ions, nitric acid, and lysine acid of each type of ionic standard solution for analysis of sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid.

There were things that could not be analyzed due to the solubility time and the solubility conditions.

The liquid crystal monolayer was in nematic phase, but I showed nematic and smectic phases and its isotropic temperature was higher than that of the monolayer.

By orienting I in homotropy pickets and thermally fusing liquid crystal monomers, it was possible to obtain a homotropy picket orientation polymer by light-fusing.

4- (6-methyloxyhexyl)oxyacetic acid 4-phenyl was prepared by light-induced polymerization of 4-isobutyl oxoacetic acid, which showed the same homotropic picking direction as liquid crystal monomers.

The properties of natural lecithin were utilized to the fullest extent in the design of original lecithin materials, and the synthetic process was examined as a result.

The process of separating the components using a chromatographic method composed of acid-phenol-inducing bodies derived from concentrated acid-phenol inducers was found to be effective for the phenol-based ligin materials.

By the appearance of the cβ-effect of the phenol nucleus in the Cβ position existing in the phenolic molecule in the ligand phenol framework, it was found that it is possible to precisely control the molecular weight and phenolic activity by controlling it.

By applying this process, it is possible to synthesize different phenolic rigidin materials at high yields, and at the same time, it is possible to supply them as industrial materials in the form of single sugars, which are composed of carbon-water compounds.

On November 18, 2000, the training ship Higashimaru of Nagasaki University encountered a marked earthquake while sailing in the Higashimaru Strait.

In this article, we report the results of earthquake observations.

Kai-shen was observed four times during the five-hour period from 7:00 to 12:00.

At the moment of the tsunami, the value of the moment of inertia, the measurement time (seconds), and the seismic intensity class according to the Seismic Intensity Scale were indicated.

According to the observations in this survey, seismic waves can propagate even in water depths of 5000 m or more.

In order to form a political consensus on the development of marine governance in the maritime areas of the coastal countries in the Asia-Pacific region, it is necessary to form a common understanding that the sea in Asia has the geographical characteristics of a semi-enclosed sea.

The semi-closed sea is extremely vulnerable to environmental and ecological changes.

Integrated management is the most difficult in the most challenging areas.

Therefore, in order to form a political consensus on integrated management, the concept of Ocean Governance, Sequing, and the Oceanian was introduced, which aims to unify ocean information from various countries.

Japanese: 情報 の 統合 が 海洋 管理 の 実効 的 な 政策 決定 に 必要 で あ る こと は ＰＥＭＳＥＡ （ Ｐａｒｔｎｅｒｓｈｉｐ 　 ｉｎ 　 Ｅｎｖｉｒｏｍｅｎｔａｌ 　 Ｍａｎａｇｅｍｅｎｔ ） に 明 示 し て 提 出 し て います 。

It is about integrating and adjusting the understanding of coastal residents' oceans so as to change the framework for political decisions and nurture political will within that framework.

This report is based on the survey results conducted in 1988.

First, in Chapter 1, we overview the geomorphology and geological and rock features, as well as the activity history seen from volcanic outbursts, based on the topography of the seabed and the characteristics of the geology and rocks, and we are trying to estimate the subsurface structure based on the results of artificial earthquakes and electrical exploration in New Island.

In Chapter 2, a single eruption in the historical era was recreated based on ancient documents.

In Chapter 3, the current volcanic activity of both islands, including earthquakes and geothermal activity, is described based on observations.

According to the results of geological surveys, if volcanic activity were to occur in the future, the initial phase would be characterized by the occurrence of extremely dangerous pyroclastic flows.

From this position, the fourth and fifth chapters discuss future activities, damage predictions, and countermeasures based on them, which are presented in [1990.5] (p. 1990.5). 〔1990.5〕

The cooling system developed and used at the Planetary Experiment Research Laboratory at Tohoku University was introduced.

Regarding temperature control systems, I also mentioned

To clarify the atmospheric-ocean exchange associated with two types of black carbon, we conducted a survey from August 2 to August 3, 1994, marked by August 2, 1994, in order to clarify the atmospheric-ocean exchange associated with two types of black carbon.

A discontinuous line of dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater was observed in the vicinity of the boundary lines of each ocean basin.

The reason for this is thought to be that there are few small water bodies with vertical mixing and little lateral movement, and that the carbon cycle acting on its own due to biological activity is activated as a result.

From the calculation of CO2 concentration, Bizen Bay and Bizen Strait are found to be the release bodies of carbon dioxide, while Dotonbori Bay is a carbon dioxide-absorbing body.

Now, the preservation of the moorland environment is urgent.

Preservation of marshlands requires the development and preservation of water environments, which is a necessary issue, and in order to implement the preservation policy, it is necessary to clarify the water balance in marshlands.

Here, the authors investigated the water balance of the Akagiya Marshland based on the results of the measurement of the discharge from the marshland and the meteorological data, and on the basis of the results of the measurement of the discharge from the marshland and the meteorological data, they discussed the water balance of the marshland.

As a result, most of the loss rainfall is due to evaporation, and it was discovered that the flooding characteristics of marshes changed due to drought in 1994.

When the wind blows from the sea to the land, due to the temperature difference between the land surface (high temperature) and the sea surface (low temperature), a thermally active boundary layer (TIBL) called convective mixing is abundant in the area where the temperature difference between the land surface and the sea surface is large.

Japanese: ＴＩＢＬ が 発達 し て い る 際 に ， 海上 や 海岸 近く に 煙源 が あ り ， そこ から 汚染 物質 が 排出 さ れ る 場合 ， その 拡散 過程 は ＴＩＢＬ の 干渉 を 受け ， 地表 面 近く に 高 濃度 が 出現 する と い う 現象 （ フュミン ） が 発生 する 。

The atmospheric dispersion of pollutants considered in this TIBL was reproduced using a wind tunnel, and the numerical calculation results and on-site measurements were compared with each other.

As a result, it became clear that there was good agreement.

As a method for searching for extraterrestrial life, the author and others began research on using light to search for life forms (microorganisms) in the universe.

According to recent information about Mars, there is a possibility that life activities exist on Mars.

For this reason, microorganisms with high potential for life were selected as the target of life exploration methods.

As an appropriate method of investigation, we used the microscopic fluorescence method to detect life forms using fluorescent pigments.

The principles of detection, the test determination method and the device, as well as the analysis of organic substances, were discussed in detail.

The human chromosomes are named in accordance with the nomenclature convention by labeling the bands obtained by chromosome banding using the chromosome banding method.

The reports on chromosome analysis are all entered in accordance with this nucleotype recording method, so it is possible to determine whether or not there are any abnormalities based on them.

Japanese: 本報 で は ， 染色 体 バント と は ， 分染 法 （ 分染 法 を 記載 する 際 の 記号 化 ， 分染 法 に よ る ヒト 染色 体 バンド 模式 図 ） ， 染色 体 境界 標 ・ 領域 ・ バンド （ 染色 体 の 境界 標 と し て の バンド ） に つ い て 解説 し た 。

The description of the band on the chromosome is written in the order of chromosome number, then the indication of the arm of the chromosome, the region number, and the band number.

There are three steps in biomechanical simulation: modeling, computation, and visualization, with modeling being the most important step.

When modeling patients for clinical use, special attention is required on both sides of accuracy and speed, i.e., in terms of both correctness and speed.

In particular, in the field of medical care for the cardiovascular system, there are problems with time constraints that directly affect the lives of patients.

In this study, we attempted to develop the clinical interface for mutual computational modeling of MR imaging of the human cardiovascular system.
