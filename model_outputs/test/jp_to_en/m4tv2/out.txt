And, with the enlargement of the original name, various reforms were carried out.

He was also sentenced to death by hanging for inciting a coup d'état, such as that of the Emperor.

Because of the destruction of the Baekje in 660 AD by the Tang Dynasty, the Baekje prince, who had stayed in the court, sent back the Baekje prince, who had stayed in the court, and brought back the Baekje dynasty.

A brief history of the city.

He died at the age of forty-six, on the 3rd day of the 12th month, in the year 672, at the age of forty-six.

(In the "Rupsan Briefing", it is said that after the death of the illness, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven, the Emperor of Heaven.)

The emperor's long reign was marked by a mysterious turn in the political history of the seventh century.

There's a lot of speculation as to what's going on.

The Emperor of Heaven and Earth is pushing for power.

In other words, according to the conventional theory, the Emperor of Heaven and Earth was the brother of the Emperor of Heaven and Earth, and it was based on the theory that the Emperor of Heaven and Earth was the half-brother of the Emperor of Heaven and Earth.

Certainly, it was published in one of the historical books of the "Japanese Book Chronicle" by the Emperor of Heavenly Wisdom and the Emperor of Heavenly Wisdom and the Emperor of Heavenly Wisdom and the Emperor of Heavenly Wisdom.

However, the discrepancy between the same fossils can be seen in the age gap of about 8 or 9 years.

In the face of this, the claim that "the father was different" or "the brother was different" or "the brother was different" or "the father was different" or "the father was different" or "the father was different" or "the father was different" is false.

From then on, the actual year of birth is 614 A.D., according to the records of the Emperor Shōwa this morning.

In fact, after the death of the emperor, the emperor himself took the throne immediately after the death of the emperor.

It's because of a mistake I made.

The change of Ebed-melech was in the hands of the humble emperor, the great-grandfather of the emperor, who was chasing the throne.

In recent years, the relationship between his elder brother, the Emperor, and Suwa, the deer, has been relatively good, and basic policies have been similar.

As it is, the motive for the Emperor's brother-in-law to kill the deer is gone.

Also, in the description of the renewal of the enlargement of the Japanese scriptures, this theory was rejected, as if it had been sung.

It is also the reason for the abdication of the Emperor, the reason for the abdication of the Emperor, the reason for the abdication of the Emperor, the reason for the abdication of the Emperor, the reason for the abdication of the Emperor.

It is said that the reign of the emperor was delayed by the reaction of the emperor against the relationship of the wise women.

This is a song written in the "Japanese Book of Chronicles" by Hideyoshi the Emperor to his wife's concubine, the Empress, suggesting an illicit relationship between her and her genius.

It was a love affair between half-brothers and half-sisters, but it was a love affair between half-brothers and half-sisters, and it was a love affair between half-brothers and half-sisters, and it was a love affair between half-brothers and half-sisters.

After the death of the Ming Emperor, the Empress, who had previously been the Empress's concubine, succeeded to the throne, but the record was erased in the matter of what happened.

This comes from the theory that the characters in the "All-Japanese Collection" are the heirs of the Emperor and the Empress, and that the Emperor and the Empress are the heirs of the Emperor and the Empress, and that the claim can be interpreted.

If the Empress is the Empress of the Middle Kingdom, why is it that she is the only one who has done this in a special way? It is necessary to consider whether she was the Empress of the Middle Kingdom or not.

Political histories and the nature and limitations of archaeological material are also difficult to prove, but the continuation of archaeological achievements and so on awaits the progress of future research.

It was also used as the basis for the earliest surviving manuscript of the Edo period, the <unk>能因本. The <unk>枕草子傍注<unk> and the <unk>枕草子春吟抄<unk> (北村季註) and the <unk>注釈書 and the <unk>セット<unk> occupied the mainstream of the manuscript until modern times.

However, after the end of the Second World War, the second edition of the book was re-evaluated and the situation was not the same as it had been when it was published.

In addition, the use of the third volume of the dictionary in the text of the dictionary can be seen in the white paintings of the late Kamakura period. The seventh volume of the dictionary also survives.

The second volume of the trilogy contains more than 300 independent chapters.

The insects, the flowers, the trees, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers.

For example, the first paragraph, "Spring is Spring", and the second paragraph, "Conversation is a Controversy", are both obscure.

When combustion infrared absorption methods are used to analyze low-carbon steel samples, the carbon concentrations vary with the standard samples, and the analyzed values vary with the certification values.

With a high concentration of carbon in the standard steel material (JSS 57 ‐ 6 % C : 0.52 % ) and a low concentration of carbon in the standard steel material (JSS 1203 ‐ 2 C : 0.0096 % ) , the two were compared and examined.

The high-density adjustment analysis value was far from the true value, and the low-density adjustment side was closer to the true value, and the tendency was to be understood.

Using low-concentration correction to analyze samples with extremely low carbon concentrations, we obtained a good result for concentration, reproduction, and characteristics.

He examined the effects of styrene and methacrylic acid on the supercritical CO2 of the Octyl-Ethyl-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O.

A thin film of PS-PFMA synthesized by continuous anion synthesis at 60 °C, CO2 saturation pressure 7.5 to 30 MPa for 1 h after being anilated, decompressed at 0 °C, 0.5 MPa/min, and foamed.

As a result, CO2 is present in the 10 nm spherical PFMA domain of the parent CO2 molecule, and the PFMA domain has functioned as a template for the formation of bubbles.

The average diameter of the foam cell increased to 10 to 30 nm and then decreased to 20 MPa.

The ellipso-meter measurement of the PS‐PFMA foam before and after measured an increase in CO2 pressure and a decrease in the refractive index of the foam cell's body composition.

Ethanol cyclohexane 2 is formed in a liquid by the bonding of a glass sphere to the surface with a hydrogen bond. Ethanol macroclusters were examined using the 1 H ‐ NMR diffraction method.

In the case of a glass sphere in a solution of ethanol-concentrated ethanol-heavy hydrogenation cyclohexane 2, the chemical shift of the protons of mainly OH, CH2 and CH3 was measured.

As a result, the spectra generated by the ethanol molecules in the bulk phase, under the influence of the addition of the glass sphere, the ethanol concentration of about 2 mol % in the addition of the glass sphere, the resonance line of the OH and CH2 protons broke further apart.

From this, the high concentration of ethanol in the glass spheres suggests the existence of two types of ethanol clusters, the exchange of ethanol molecules between the surface and the bulk clusters.

As part of the development of an environmental-harmonious catalyst, we have fixed organic bases to the regularity of the species in silicate, created an inorganic-organic hybrid catalyst, and considered its catalyst performance.

Here, we have considered the post-synthesis processing and organic base modification of the MCM‐22 (MWW) of the Borosilicate type.

It is composed of two independent, two-dimensional 10-membered ring supercages and a 12-membered ring supercage. The product of crystallization immediately after crystallization forms a layered precursor body, and when baked, the MWW structure is produced, which is peeled off in layers to expose the supercage, allowing a 12-membered ring pocket on the surface.

It was thought to be used in response to the reaction of the large base, such as this pocket adjacent to the organic base.

Also, by removing the layer and increasing the outer surface, along with microparticle formation, the high-performance formation of a single layer of this catalyst can be expected.

He found that it was possible to synthesize urethane by using 4° ammonium salt as an ionic liquid and ring-shaped amines.

However, with the use of ethyl methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate and trifluoroborate methyl sulfonyl imidase, the ring-shaped urethane yielded only 0 to 16 percent.

The pressure dependency is 10 MPa, and the selection rate is the highest.

It has been hypothesized that the supercritical oxidation of carbon occurs at the same rate and with the same reaction mechanism.

The destruction of the ozone layer by the replacement of fluorine has been considered in connection with the development of a new generation of hydrogen-based chemicals, which will have less impact on global warming.

He developed the practical application and manufacturing technology of two innovative types of semiconductor-based composites (half-conductor, dry-etched, octa-fluoro-cyclopentene, and precision-washed solvent, hepta-fluoro-cyclopentene) with a five-ring structure.

These compounds have the destructive power of the ozone layer, and their effects on global warming are characterized by their small size.

The characteristics of this technology are unique molecular design, environmental compatibility, and high performance.

For the sake of a new and unique molecular structure that reflects the characteristics of the five-membered ring, it has been adapted to advanced fields with high performance.

In order to reveal the mass, length, radius, and density of the fibers of the low-temperature induced fibrinogen gel, the wavelength of the 400 to 800 nm wavelength was measured at 2 °C.

Fibrinogen molecules combine to form rod-shaped fibrinogen fibers, the structure of which is triggered by thrombin compared to fibrin fibers in thick flesh.

In addition, we examined the effects of glucose, manganese, and dextrin additives.

Glucose and manganese additives at low temperatures have been found to have a delayed and heterogeneous effect.

On the other hand, the addition of deoxyribonucleic acid at low temperatures has been promoted, and its effect has been to increase the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid molecules.

The results obtained with these cryogels are consistent with those of thrombin-induced fibrillation, which is thought to be useful in solving the mechanism of low-temperature gelation.

In order to investigate the growth process of the smallest hardening unit, we changed the exposure time of the ultraviolet rays and observed:

In this case, the intensity of the light is changing in the direction of progress, so the incoming light used parallel light.

From experiments and theoretical considerations, the growth process became clear, and the simulation of the hardening growth process was established.

He developed a new form-changing light-recording material based on a matrix of high-molecule colorants mixed with membranes, and studied the recording principle and dynamic recording characteristics.

Combined with high-molecular-weight polyethylene (3-alkyl thiophene) and synthetic naphthalene-based dyes, it forms a thin film on a glass substrate using the spin coat method.

The membrane showed the reversibility of optical changes due to heating and cooling.

The possibility of a change in the evaluation of the practical nature of the disk conversion has not been disclosed.

Based on the author's experience while using a high-pressure fluid equilibrium device to measure the fluid equilibrium, he stated:

Temperature control technology has been developed, and precise experiments have been carried out.

The standardization of pipes and so on has progressed, and the maintenance has become easier thanks to the progress of silk and so on.

Also, the use of AV equipment, such as video, supercritical fluid chromatography, etc. has led to the possibility of a new measurement technology.

The silica particles (particle diameter 103 nm) dispersed in a liquid-plate-shaped quartz cell (width-width wavelength = 10 mm) indicated the proximity of the colloid single crystal to the color photograph, which was followed by a commentary.

Structural crystals can only exist in dead spaces, and they manifest themselves in extremely simple principles.

When the D <unk> Deff relationship is established between the particle distance (D) and the effective radius (Deff) of the particle containing the electric double layer, the particle vibrates only in equilibrium, and the crystal is shaped like this.

The elasticity of the colloid crystal system, the viscosity, the response to the external field, has been described.

The analysis of markings can be simplified by using conventional light-absorption analysis methods or comparison methods.

In this paper, salt, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfuric acid were added to six types of organic reagents, such as sodium nitrate, hydrochloric acid, and hydrochloric acid, to analyze the standard solution of ionic species.

The dissolution time, the dissolution conditions, the analysis, and so on.

Considering the solubility time of the main ingredient, it was concluded that it could be analyzed by setting the solubility conditions. [1994: 10]

He synthesized high-molecular liquid crystals (I) by combining homeotropic pick liquid crystals (I) with resting aromatic acids (I) and phenyl acetate (I) to synthesize high-molecular liquid crystals (I).

Liquid crystals, a single-dimensional body, have been shown to be neomatic and smooth, and their equilibrium temperature has been higher than a single-dimensional body.

I was able to combine the homeopathic pick with the liquid crystal single-volume body, and I was able to combine the homeopathic pick with the origami.

4 - ( 6 - Metacrylic Liroxychloroquine Oxy ) Relaxed aromatic acid 4 - Biphenyl than light weighted I have indicated the direction of the liquid crystal monomers with the same homeotropic pickup

In addition to designing original lignin materials that maximize the properties of natural lignin, he presented the results of his synthesis process.

Induced lignin materials, such as concentrated acids, are composed of phenol-induced compounds that are separated and processed in an effective manner.

He found that the phenol-induced ligno is able to control the amount of the molecule and the phenol activity in a precise way, due to the expression of adjacent base effects against the C β-position of the phenol nucleus, which exists inside the molecule.

By applying this process, it is possible to synthesize different phenolic lignin materials with high yields and at the same time to supply hydrocarbons in the form of monosaccharides as industrial materials.

On November 18, 2000, Nagasaki University's training ship, the Tsuyoshi, was hit by an undersea earthquake.

In this article, we reported on the results of the earthquake observations.

The earthquake was observed four times in five hours, from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m.

The time of the earthquake, the location, the measurement time (second), the magnitude of the earthquake are shown in the scale.

This year's observations have shown that earthquakes can be transmitted to water depths of more than 5,000 meters.

As a starting point for coordinating and integrating the maritime policies of coastal countries towards the maritime governance of Asian waters, a common understanding of the geographical characteristics of Asia's seas, including semi-closed seas, is needed.

Half-closed oceans are extremely vulnerable to environmental and ecological threats.

It's hard to manage the integration, but it's in the ocean.

There, in order to form a political will for integrated management, the concept of Ocean Governance and Securing the Ocean has been introduced, aiming at the unification of ocean information of countries.

The integration of information is needed to make effective policy decisions on ocean management, according to the PEMSEA (Partnership in Environmental Management for East Asia).

It integrates and coordinates the perception of the oceans by the inhabitants of coastal societies, and from there it transforms the framework of political decisions to foster political will.

The report was the result of a survey carried out in 1988.

In the first chapter, we'll take a look at the geography of the island, including the seabed, the geology of the island, the features of the rocks, and the activity seen from the eruptions. We'll try to estimate the underground structure of the island based on artificial earthquakes and electrical exploration.

The second chapter was based on an ancient document and reproduced only one eruption of the historical period.

The third chapter describes the current earthquake and volcanic activity on both islands based on the results of the observations.

Based on the results of geological surveys, if an eruption occurs in the future, the early stages of activity are predicted to be extremely dangerous.

From this point of view, the fourth and fifth chapters are based on forecasts of future activities and suggestions for countermeasures.

The East University Department of Physics has developed and used a planetary experimentation laboratory to introduce a cooling system.

He and Ne explained the separation and the temperature change, and showed the absorption-release curve (temperature-release gas %).

It also shows the absorption-release curve due to changes in the temperature of Ar, Kr and Xe.

He also mentioned the temperature control system.

In order to explain the atmospheric-oceanic exchange of carbon dioxide, research was carried out on the 2nd to 3rd of August in the year 94.

In the vicinity of the boundary lines of the various sea areas, non-continuous lines of carbon dioxide oxidation in seawater were observed.

This is due to the fact that there is a small amount of water in the mixture that moves horizontally and vertically, and the carbon cycle itself is thought to be driven by biological activity.

From the calculation of the CO2 concentration, the beach and the reservoir were the release bodies of carbon dioxide, and the seeding beaches were the absorption bodies.

Today, the preservation of the wetlands and the environment is urgent.

The preservation of wetlands requires the maintenance and preservation of the water environment, and when the conservation measures are discussed, it is necessary to clarify the cost of water in wetlands.

There, the authors examined the wetlands of the Red River Valley as a subject, the results of the measurement of the amount of water flowing from the wetlands, and the weather data from the wetlands themselves.

As a result, much of the loss of rainfall was due to evaporation, and in 1994 it was discovered that the water had brought about a change in the drainage characteristics of the wetlands.

When sea winds blow from the sea to land, the difference in temperature between the land surface (high temperature) and the sea surface (low temperature) causes a region of intermingling currents called the thermal inner boundary layer (TIBL) to appear on land.

When a TIBL develops, there is a source of smoke at sea or near the coast, from which pollutants are released, and the process of its spread receives the TIBL's dust, and high concentrations appear near the surface, causing a phenomenon known as the fumigation phenomenon.

Taking into account this TIBL, we re-enacted the atmospheric diffusion phenomenon of pollutants using wind tunnels, and compared the results of numerical calculations and field experiments.

As a result, I understood what I was saying.

In an attempt to explore extraterrestrial life, the author began his research by using light to explore microorganisms in space.

Human chromosomes are labelled according to the chromosome distribution method, and the bands are labelled according to the naming convention.

The report of the chromatography test is all written in this nuclear typing method, and there are no abnormalities to be judged.

In this article, we have explained the coloring system, the coloring system, the coloring system, the coloring system, and the coloring system.

The labeling of the chromosome band begins with the chromosome number, followed by the chromosome arm indication, the area number, in order of the number of the band.

The three steps of computational biomechanics simulation are modeling, calculation, and visualization, and modeling is the first and most important step.

In the case of clinical application, special attention is needed in both the accuracy and speed of the patient's modeling.

Medical care, especially in the cardiovascular system, is directly involved in the patient's life, and there are also severe time constraints.

In this study, we tried to develop interactive clinical interfaces for MRI imaging of the human cardiovascular system, computational mechanics, and modeling.

The existing sugar chain structure analysis method combines the extraction of sugar chains from complex sugars (such as proteins) and processes such as separation refining and fluorescent marking, requiring complex operations and time and skill to obtain accurate data.

In order to further the development of sugar chain research, it is necessary to establish a methodology for the easy preparation of sugar chain samples and the existence of market kits.

Regarding the title, the selective capture of sugar chains (Glycoblotting) is based on the pattern of sugar chain refining, the high-molecular microparticles that capture sugar chains, and the case of glucose chain analysis in human serum (MALDI‐TOF Mass Spectrum).

He also introduced the use of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to conduct polyphenol-type food engineering research.

"We're going to be measuring the activity of the neural network at multiple points at the same time", he said, referring to the improvement in the production of micro-probes and electrical properties.

This Si microprobe, using Au as a catalyst, Si as a gas source, and Si 2 H 6 as a liquid-liquid-solid (VLS) crystal growth law, formed on the Si (111) base plate.

This probe, with a very small voltage change of about 10 μV, is a very useful detection device for measuring nerve signals, and the size of this probe is suitable for recording nerve activity.

Comparing the results of the various measurements of the Au electrode, the Pt electrode, and the Ir electrode, it was found that the Ir electrode had the lowest value in terms of signal frequency of 1 kHz.

The authors use networked and quantitative sugar chain structural analysis as a starting point, from the analysis of sugar chain carriers, protein sequences, and peptide sequences, to the identification of genome information, to the basic strategy of glycoform-focused reverse genomics (GFRG), and to the exploration of new disease biomarkers.

In this article, I reported on the new methods of argumentation and structural analysis that are necessary for this approach.

The GFRG method involves tagging sugars, fishing for sugar peptide fragments, proteome analysis, obtaining genome information, identifying sugar-protein properties, and profiling sugars for non-uniformity.

In addition to outlining the specific procedures of the GFRG, the GFRG has demonstrated the results of the analysis of the sugar-protein content distributed to the skin of the mouse.

In addition, GFRG has pointed out the challenges and solutions to sugar chain structural analysis.

The GFRG method is based on a carrier protein from a sugar-containing tag, and furthermore, it analyzes the structure of the genetic material in reverse, which is thought to be a promising strategy for the high-throughput exploration of new disease markers.

I analyzed it to determine the location and nature of the power source, measuring the auditory stimulation of the brain magnetoid at a depth of 10 to 70 ms.

The auditory stimulus lasted 1 . 0 ms, giving the examiner a clicking sound on one side of the ear, and the stimulus interval was 5 to 10 s.

The stimulation on the side and the opposite side of the ear gave the masking noise a lasting effect.

The induced brain magnetic diagram uses a 7 ch one-dimensional differential model (DC-SQUID) to measure the lateral head of the stimulated side and the opposite side at 42 to 49 points in the center.

Interfaces, active ingredients, cooking methods of enzymes, and non-hydraulic media are subjected to esterification reactions, and the author has focused on their research.

Coconuts and earthworms are characteristic of living on the Antarctic continent, where liquid water is scarce and the atmosphere is dry.

Light intensity and temperature, the amount of water attached to the surface, and the amount of water in the body also vary with the rate of light synthesis.

The optimum temperature for light synthesis is between 10 and 16 degrees Celsius in Koké, and below 10 degrees Celsius in Ginza.

Coconuts are often grown in poorly-nourished sandy soils, attached to the surface of the coconut, and have the ability to fix nitrogen in the algae, which can be ignored as nutrients.

This was thought to be part of the macrophage-stimulating colony's genetic material, and it was thought to be part of the macrophage's genetic material.

We synthesized the synthesized cDNA into a λ gt 10 and selected the DNA obtained by PCR as a probe.

Trien's type gave him a different influence than the others. [1994: 3]

I examined the adhesion of the fibrous germ cell (F) to the gel-formed collagen 1 and the collagen (C) to the collagen.

As a result, F aged and accelerated the contraction of C's volume, and F made it clear that he was going to shrink the collagen gel.

The rate of proliferation of tumor-like cells depends on the concentration of C-gels, and is unlimitedly high.

Site Karasin D has induced polarity by opposing the F in C gel.

In this way, the site suggested that Karasin D was giving a change to the cell skeleton.[995]

In addition to the existing lectins, we have refined the existing lectins (T) and other lectins into new ones.

I made ten kinds of caramels with these and soaked them in Sepharose.

These were then tested for tritium markers and systematically absorbed to reveal the sugar chain structure of the sample.

The material used for the test was a combination of histamine, serum choline esterase, and serum choline esterase in healthy people and liver cell cancer patients, and the samples revealed the structure of each sugar chain.

It has also been linked to fetal antigens in digestive cancers, and T-lectin has been shown to be a possible determinant of differential colon cancer.

In addition, researchers have identified abnormal genetic material in rheumatoid arthritis patients and analyzed how it is involved in the disease, as well as the cause of the disease.

Using chromosomes obtained from 63 victims of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, radiation-induced chromosomes with abnormal shapes and frequencies, G-band methods, reported the results of the analysis.

Cells with stable abnormalities accounted for the majority of abnormal cells, indicating an increase in the frequency of abnormalities, sometimes dose-dependent.

All stable types of abnormalities have been classified into nine groups: mutual translocation, complex translocation, insertion, interacting protons, reverse positions, polarized protons, reverse positions, ends, missing parts, and intermediate missing parts.

As a result of a statistical analysis of the 3370 cuts involved in mutual transfer, a high correlation was found between the relative DNA volume of each chromosome and the distribution of the number of chromosome cuts [1994: 6].

In the 5′ area, only four types of people are seen in the United States, and only three types of people are seen in Japan.

The percentage of types is the same as that of normal people, but in cases of myocardial infarction, the type D is less active.

In the case of a heart attack, high levels of lipoproteins (a) in the blood are thought to be the cause.

The effects of UV-B radiation on the ion transport system have been investigated.

As a result, we have observed a phenomenon in which K+ is emitted unusually strongly by UV‐B.

I checked the amount of light and the wavelength depending on the sex.

The effect of K+ emission spectrum is close to 270 nm at peak, indicating sensitive wavelength dependence.

The involvement of the photoreceptor, which absorbs about 270 nm, has been suggested.

This article describes the preparation of enzymes in organic solvents and the use of enzymes in organic solvents as the center of the esterization reaction.

Color perception is often subjective, often misguided, and so on.

In this study, I tried to apply color simultaneous contrast illusion and color appearance illusion to the subject, using a mutually inhibited neural circuitry network to engineer color illusion.

Specifically, it assumed mutual inhibitory dynamics between neurons located within the color space, the minimum necessary for the surface color.

As a result of the computer simulation, 1 and 2 were able to reproduce the color on the computer by showing the same tendency to subjectively perceive color when viewed by humans.

With the aim of investigating the synthesis mechanism and expression regulation mechanism of HNK-1 sugar chain antigen and unraveling the mechanism of autoimmune disease, the rate of synthesis of this sugar chain antigen was examined in relation to the glucuronic acid transfer enzyme (GT).

The cloning of GT's cDNA from the rat brain, the base sequence of the clone, and then the speculation of the amino acid sequence, made clear.

As a result of the comparison, HNK‐1 sugar-chain antigens have been shown to be potentially highly conserved in the GT system, suggesting that the HNK‐1 sugar-chain antigens have been shown to be highly conserved in the GT system.

As a result of forced expression in cultured cells using GT's cDNA, HNK‐1 sugar chain antigens were induced on the cell surface.

In addition, I was able to isolate the Maus GT gene.

The crocodile, which swims at high speed, is eager to accumulate large-scale farming.

In order to design the most appropriate shelter, taking into account the effects of tides and waves, and to calculate the underwater shape of a network-shaped structure that constitutes a facility, a mechanical calculation model was introduced to the defining law.

In this model, the network is composed of multiple mass points, and the mass is concentrated at the junction, assuming that the mass point is attached to the mass point without being able to ignore it.

Using this calculation model, we calculated the shape and action of the large-scale aquaculture crocodile in the water, the flow conditions of the load, and evaluated the resistance of the facility.

In the future, we have calculated what kind of movements, transformations, and forces will affect the whole system.

In the vicinity of the white-sand wetlands from the tail swamp to the sunshine, I observed the change in the disease state of the white-sand area by setting up six research trees that were determined to be more susceptible to disease.

In the first part, he outlined the activities of the civic center and the activities of the local residents, including: 1) the central office, headed by the mayor of the village of Hideyoshi; 2) the branch office, headed by the mayor of the village of Rimei; 3), the activities of the civic center in Rikawa; 4), the operation of the civic center, and so on.

Next, in the second part, he outlined the "regional activities of the district civil service and women", including: 1 ) the location of the problem; 2 ) the learning of the civil service and women; 3 ) the activities of the district civil service and women; 4 ) the life challenges of the mountainous region; 5 ) the factors that boosted the vitality of women.

At the end of the chapter, he proposed a strategy to boost the energy of the region between the mountains. [1995.9]

In the development of lignin utilization, the synthesis of phenol-based lignin-induced compounds and their functional recycling complexes combined with cellulose fibers were considered.

In the case of black pine, the fat-removing properties of cadmium wood, p-krezole, sulfuric acid were added, and lignin-krezole, extracted with acetone, was synthesized.

Immersing fiberglass molds for recycled paper in a solution of lignin-crezole, creating a melted compound, heating it to thermal melting, and considering its functional properties.

As a result, the complex has high strength, superior water characteristics, and dimensional stability.

It's a simple solvent treatment, it's composite, it's separated into materials, it's recycled, it's possible.

This document reported on the results of a five-year study on the effects of agricultural management disruption on the logging nature of the mountainous forests in Hokkaido, Tōhoku.
