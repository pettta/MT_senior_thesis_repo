And later, there was a declaration of a two-party lineage in the Great Plains.

Later, Sun Yat-sen revived the declaration of the Great Plains.

Zhang Ziyi built a new movement based on music theory.

Since then, it has been the centerpiece of the Declaration of Independence and has been succeeded by the present Declaration of Independence.

The statement of the true religion of the earth is a series of statements of the heavens and the earth

The statement of truth is based on what the air and sea have told us, and it has survived to the present day.

The statements have been systematized since the reign of the emperor.

It is not a dynasty, but it is the ancestor of the Middle Kingdom.

The composition and preparation of the statement

Until the Kamakura period, there were many schools, but by the time of the Emperor, they were grouped into four schools: the current corresponding house, the new corresponding house, the current corresponding house, the current corresponding house, and the current corresponding house.

The declaration of the Old Testament was weakened and abolished by the Edo period.

By the middle of the Meiji period, the current had disappeared.

At present, it is divided into the  ⁇ 智山 (ちざん) statement (Kyoto 智積 院)  ⁇ 豊山 ( ⁇ ざん) statement (Nara-Nagano Temple) and the  ⁇ 南山進流 (Nanchan-ryū, Takano Mountain, Kyoto, and the ancient True Word Temple).

The statement of the two factions is based on the Chinese-Chinese-Chinese-Chinese-Chinese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese-Japanese.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do about it.

In 1583, when the temple was burned down by Hideyoshi, the two factions of Hideyoshi and Hideyoshi formed the Hideyoshi faction.

Characteristically, it is known as the "Discussion" of Mount Fuji and the "Declaration" of Mount Fuji.

Later, he took the nickname of Mount Takano, the Southern Mountain, and called it the Southern Mountain Progress.

It is also known as the Wild Mountain Current.

The music, such as flutes, drums, folk music, and brass bands, is a translation of the statement.

The influence of simple melody music has been great.

In his lifetime, he was probably known as the Prince of the Castle.

Generally known as the middle eldest brother, Prince.

Overview of the project

The second prince of Emperor Shumin.

My mother was the Empress Dowager (later the Empress Dowager).

The Empress is the daughter of the half-brother, the eldest brother, the crown prince, and the king.

He plotted a coup d'état, killed Su Zhen, and installed his uncle, Emperor Hyakutoku, as emperor. He himself became emperor.

Then he enacted the Great Purge and made various reforms.

Also, the death penalty was imposed on those who would later stage a coup d'état, such as the Prince of Peace.

Because of the destruction of Baekje by Tang Xinglo in 660, he sent back Prince Baekje, who was staying at the court, and planned the restoration of Baekje.

He stayed in Tsukiji to direct the rescue of the Baekje, but in 661 B.C.E., Emperor Huangming collapsed (died).

After that, he immediately assumed the throne for a long time, but after suffering a heavy defeat in the Battle of Baimura River in 663, he moved to the city of Odajin and ascended the throne there.

After the battle of Baimura River, as part of the national defense policy, water castles, lighthouses, and barricades were installed.

And the crown is also carrying out institutional reforms from the nineteenth to the twenty-sixth floor.

In addition, in 670 C.E., the country's oldest national household register, the Year of the Rabbit, was compiled.

According to the Japanese Chronicle, Emperor Tianji left the throne to the first emperor, Emperor Daimyo.

However, in the riots that erupted after the death of the Emperor, his brother, the Emperor of the Sea (Emperor Tianwu), defeated his great friend, the Emperor, and ascended the throne.

Since then, the emperors of the Tianwu dynasty have continued until the Emperor Tokugawa.

After the death of the emperor, the grandson of the emperor, King Baekje, was crowned emperor, and after that, the emperor's dynasty.

It is said that he sent four of his daughters as wives to the Great Sea Prince in order to atone for taking King Akita from the Great Sea Prince.

A brief history of

34 B.C.E. (626 B.C.) - Born

Emperor Emperor 4 June 14 (July 12, 645) - Prince of Li

July 24, 661 B.C.E. (August 24, 661 B.C.E.) - equinox

January 3, 7 A.D. (February 20, 668 B.C.E.) - Ascension to the throne

He died on December 3, 672 at the age of 46.

In the "Risan Summary", after the theory of sickness and death, there is also a theory of assassination by the Emperor of Heavenly Wealth because it is said that the Emperor of Heavenly Wealth was killed by unknown causes in the mountains.

The short reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang is one of the mysteries of mid-seventh-century political history.

There are many theories that are being discussed on this subject.

In the meantime, however, I was able to continue my study of the Bible.

In other words, the traditional hypothesis that the Emperor Tianwu was the younger brother of the Emperor Tianxi is wrong, and it is based on the theory that the Emperor was the Emperor Han, who was born before the Emperor Shumin married him, and that he was the half-brother of the Emperor Tianxi.

In fact, if you count the age of the Emperor Tianji in the "Japanese Chronicle" and the age of the Emperor Tianwu in some history books, Tianwu will be older.

However, there is no contradiction between the same sources, and there are many sources with an age difference of about eight or nine years.

In response to this, it is claimed that "even though his father was different, it was bad manners for him to leave his brother behind, so he deliberately raised the age of genius", but "the age of genius, 16 years old, as it appears in the Japanese Chronicle, was the age at which his father, Emperor Shumin, was crowned, and was mistaken for the age at which he collapsed".

Therefore, the actual year of birth is 614, as adopted by the Tang Dynasty Chronicle and others.

'An unusual vacancy in antiquity (in fact, the genius and control that existed before and after the Emperor prevailed and did not immediately take the throne) '

There's been an error because of that.

There is also the opinion that the other historical books referred to as the "Japanese Chronicle" cannot be treated in the same way because of the different times and nature in which they were compiled.

(See also the section entitled "The Emperor's Age").

It is said that the emperor's great-uncle, Emperor Hideyoshi, was ousted from his position.

In recent years, the relationship between the elder brother and the prince has been relatively good, and it has been pointed out that the basic policies are similar.

Then the middle brother and the prince will have no motive to kill the deer.

In addition, the revision of the description of the enlargement of the Japanese textbook allowed for the revision, which led to this theory.

Also, this theory has attracted attention because it can explain the reasons for the abdication of the Emperor, the reasons why Su Su was not exiled after the coup, and other questions.

Theories that the delay in the accession was caused by a backlash against the relationship of the wise woman.

This suggests that the song sung by Emperor Hideyoshi to his wife's concubine, the Empress (the half-sister of the Divine Wisdom), in the Japanese Book of Records, suggests an adulterous relationship between her and the Divine Wisdom.

It's the first time I've seen it. It's the first time I've seen it. It's the first time I've seen it.

After the death of the Ming Emperor, the Empress Ming succeeded to the throne as the consort of the previous emperors, but it is believed that the records were erased under some circumstances.

This is a claim that can be interpreted as a succession of emperors to the throne of the gods.

If the Empress Mediatrix = <unk> 中 皇命 <unk>, it can be assumed that why she alone had the need to be called by these special titles, but there are also theories that she is the Empress Empress, not necessarily confirmed.

The nature of the political history and the constraints of the historical material are difficult to prove, but the progress of future research is awaited, including the link with archaeological finds.

The song.

He is also a singer of four songs in the manga series.

He was honored as the great-grandfather of the Ming Dynasty, and the following song appears at the beginning:

The grass of the field in autumn, the grass of the field in autumn, my clothes wet with dew

The following is from the book of Revelation:

If the mountain of incense loves its neighbor and contends with the ear, it will be more expensive than the temple of God. If the mountain of incense loves its neighbor and contends with the ear, it will be more expensive than the temple of God.

The West Garden Temple is a public house that draws water from Mr. Fujiwara's stream.

Mr. Fujura Fujura North House in the courtyard of the courtyard of the courtyard

The Toyotomi Hideyoshi family is a branch of the Western Temple family.

Also, there is an influential branch of the Izu martial arts family called the Western Garden Temple, which is named after the Western Garden Temple.

The family coat of arms uses the left triangle.

The Western Temple family adopts Fujura, the third son of Fujura, as their ancestor.

He was imprisoned in the court as a prisoner of the Kamakura shogunate during the Shogunate Rebellion. After the rebellion, he received the trust of the shogunate and assumed the power of the court as the Kanto shogunate. He rose to the rank of minister of the shogunate.

The name of the West Garden Temple is derived from the name of the temple that the Emperor built in his mansion in Kyoto, Japan.

This temple, also known as the North Mountain Temple, is the current temple of the Golden Temple, which was built on land expropriated by the Western Temple family.

Since then, it has received the support of the Takakura shogunate, and through the Takakura period, it has been a force to be reckoned with.

It's the first time I've seen it. It's the first time I've seen it.

However, after his son's defeat at the Western Temple, when the Great Temple began to distance itself from the shogunate, he deepened his conflict with the Great Temple by supporting the Order of the Rising Sun.

After that, when the Western Garden Temple was inaugurated, the Takura Shogunate was destroyed and Kanto Shinjuku was relieved of his duties.

After concealing Mr. Hideyoshi's remaining party, Mr. Hideyoshi, and starting a new policy of "building weapons", he plotted a conspiracy to assassinate the Emperor and support the Emperor in the aftermath of the Ming Dynasty. The plan was exposed by an informant of his brother, Mr. Hideyoshi.

In the period of the Southern Hokkaido Dynasty, the son of the royal family, Hokusai, served the Northern Hokkaido (Japan) and became the right minister, restoring the family name.

In the Edo period, it was also known as the house where the harp was played.

In the early days of Edo, the West Garden Temple welcomed the eldest daughter of Nagato, Tokyo, to the kitchen. Nagato also donated 600 stones as a legacy to the West Garden Temple family.

In the end, he was adopted by the Tokugawa family of the same court, and through the Meiji Restoration, he became active as a politician, serving as a cabinet minister, and as an elder, he became a heavyweight in the political life of Daisuke Showa.

By the way, it is said that he was unable to play the violin, which is a household chore of the Western Temple family, but during the Prime Minister's tenure from Emperor Meiji to the evil half, he had not heard the violin of the Western Temple family for a long time, and was forced to suffer four times by the staff of the Yara dormitory in the province of Hokkaido and the performance of the violin.

It is located in the western part of the city of Okazaki, Shiga Prefecture, and in the northeastern part of the city of Kyoto.

It is the collective name for a double peak consisting of two peaks: the Great Wisdom (848.3 m) located on the border of the prefectures of Ozu and Shinjuku, and the Fourth Mountain (868 m) located in Shinjuku, Kyoto.

The equilateral triangle of the Great Wisdom is located in the city of Daegu.

Along with Mount Takano, it is considered to be an older mountain of faith, and it has been the site of a thriving temple and a Japanese corporation.

It is included in the Tōhoku (Kyoto Prefecture)

It is also known as the Wayan, the North Ridge, the Tian, the Mountain, the City, and the Fuji.

Summary

It may be located northeast of Kyoto's ghost gate.

In ancient texts, the mountain is referred to as the "Mountain of the Sun", and it is said that the god of the mountains settled on the mountain of the sun in the Xinjiang region and incarnated the god of the sun.

Since the opening of the temple in Nishikori, the god of the mountains has been worshipped as the god of the earth, the god of the sky, the god of the mountains, the god of the mountains.

It is also a mountain of faith, where you can worship the temples at the top of the mountain and the shrine at the foot of the mountain.

Climbing is also popular, with typical climbing routes ranging from Kyoto City's Shinjuku Prefecture's Shinjuku Prefecture's Shinjuku Prefecture's Shinjuku Prefecture to Shinjuku Prefecture's Shinjuku Prefecture's Shinjuku Prefecture's Shinjuku Prefecture's Shinjuku Prefecture.

It has long been a route for monks, nuns, and courtiers to and from Kyoto and Yangon, and is still frequented by mountaineers.

In the mountains, the Tōhoku Natural Trail runs from Osaka to Kyoto.

There are toll roads, cable cars, and ropeways to the top of the mountain, which attracts many tourists on holidays.

There used to be a ski resort and an artificial ski resort, but by 2002 they were all closed. The ski resort site is now a museum, a garden, a museum, and a ski resort.

There was also a forest resort on the Kyoto side, which was closed on November 30, 2001, and a membership-only resort hotel was built on the site.

The Great Wisdom and the Four Minutes

In the survey results by the National Institute of Geography, the summit of the east is called the Great Mountain, the summit of the west is called the Four Mountains, and the summit of the west is called the Mountain of Wisdom.

In the dot symbol, the dot of the equilateral triangle at the top of the east is called "Mount Wisdom".

This triangle is located on the border of the cities of Osaka and Kyoto, but is located in the city of Osaka.

If you look at Mount Wisdom from the Kyoto Basin, it's hard to identify the summit of Mount Wisdom. You might think that Mount Seven is the summit of Mount Wisdom.

It is located on the Kyushu Electric Railway, on the Weishan ropeway, on the summit of Mount Shimin, and is designated as the Weishan Peak Station.

There are many theories as to the spelling or reading of the name, including the name of the city of Kyoto, the name of the city, the name of the city, the name of the city, the name of the city, the name of the city, the name of the city, the name of the city.

The name of the mountain is derived from the name of the mountain in the People's Republic of China.

Tōhoku, fifty-three times

In the Edo period, there were 53 lodgings in Tōhoku, which connected Edo (Japan Bridge (Tokyo Central District) ) and Kyoto (Samsung Bridge).

Explained in this paragraph

It's been fifty-three times.

Tōhoku-do fifty-three (tōhoku-do fifty-three) refers to the fifty-three lodgings on the Tōhoku-do main road (street) that passes through Tōhoku-do during the Edo period.

Each of these 53 lodgings is often located in scenic locations or famous landmarks. It was often the subject of frescoes, hymns, and haiku of the time.

If it is called fifty-three times, it is up to Kyoto, and if it is called fifty-seven times, it is up to Osaka.

"Pillow Grass" is a pencil that is said to have been written by the female writer of the mid-Penguin period, Chiang Kai-shek.

It is also marked as <unk> Pillow Paper <unk> <unk> Pillow Booklet <unk> <unk> Pillow Double Paper <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

It was the first time in my life that I had ever seen such a book.

As a medieval literary duo comparable to the "Tales of the Source", it had a great influence on later songs, haiku, and pseudonyms.

It is known as Japan's third-largest list of history and satire, alongside the "Bangabeo Book" by Yamamoto Yamamoto and the "Useless Grass" by Yoshida Yamamoto.

It has a very unique style, and some similarities are pointed out to the compilation of the late Tang poet Li Zhongyuan (written as Yishan), but no documents have been found.

According to the text at the end of the volume, the motivation for writing and the origin of the name are that when the Minister of the Interior, Izu Fujiwara, presented his sister, Fujiwara Nakamura, and an emperor with a paper that was still expensive at the time, the emperor did not write the "History", but when the palace asked him how to write it, he immediately replied, "It's a pillow".

And then there's the paper that was given to me from the palace, and then there's the paper that was given to me from the palace, and then there's the paper that was given to me from the palace.

It is also said to be the origin of the name of the pillow grass.

According to Lin Hikawa, "The Study of the Pillow Grass", the autobiography lists researchers from the past, such as Chi, Okinawa, Fukuoka, Shizuoka, Ikeda, and others.

Next, give a representative theory of the meaning of the pillow.

The bedspread theory: a play on the words "pillow" and "pillow".

Authors' encyclopedia: Because of the many chapters that list the words "song pillow", "satisfaction", and "satisfaction"

Memorandum theory: the meaning of a grass that can be placed under a pillow as a memorandum

Treasures of the Book

It doesn't matter.

But it's not a myth.

Also, in "The Story of the Beautiful Flower", the common noun used to describe color is "pillow", "grass", and "grass".

The founding of the original manuscript is also said to have taken place around the second year of the Tang Dynasty (996 A.D.) when the left-handed general took it out of the author's house and spread it around the world.

After that, it was written continuously, and some of it seems to have been written towards the end of his life.

Some of the texts of the "Pillow Grass" quoted in the ancient annotations of the "Pillow Grass" are not extant, suggesting a complex process of formation.

The differences between the biographies are enormous.

It takes the form of a collection, consisting of three volumes.

According to the elderly and foolish person who thinks he is the Fujiwara family, the books containing the second year of Antsun's death (in 1228) are:

It is considered to be the closest to the archaic.

However, according to Ikeda, there are two types of sharks.

The second book of the series (Class B) - 300 pages

I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to do it.

The lineage is said to have been related to the Shinto priest (one of the sisters is the chamber of Shinto's real son, the shrine chief) who was related to Shinto.

It dates back to the late Kamakura period.

The result of the debate between the three volumes of the book and the good book is that it is now almost certain that the source book of the energy book is inferior to the source book.

230 volumes, excluding the first 70 volumes.

300 stories and books.

It is believed to be the oldest of the "Pillow Grass" manuscripts, written before the Kamakura period.

Of these, the first, the second, the third, the third, the third, the third, the third, the third, the third, the third.

In addition, the book was used as the basis for the ancient calligraphic editions of the early Edo period, so it became the main stream of biographical books until modern times in the form of commentaries and sets such as "Pillow Grass Side Notes" and "Pillow Grass Spring Dawn Notes".

However, in the 21st year of the Showa era (1946), the second volume of the trilogy was re-evaluated by Takayuki Takayuki (1917-1987), and after World War II, it was published entirely by him, and the textbook was adopted and read.

Another white-painted scroll from the late Kamakura period, "Pillow Grass Picture Words", which appears to have used the three-volume book of biographies for the text of the dictionary, also survives in seven parts.

The second volume of the trilogy contains more than 300 independent chapters.

It consists of a variety of texts, such as insects, flowers, trees, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers.

There are also sections that are most ambiguous about how to classify them (for example, the first section, "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn", "Spring is Dawn").

Written in a concise spoken form of syllabic pronouns using pronouns, it is generally full of light-hearted short stories, but it also reflects the downfall of the Tang Dynasty and the misfortune that befell the Empress Dowager.

The author's sophisticated senses and sharp observation of things combine to reveal the beautiful world of the intellectual darkness against the emotional darkness of the "Tales of the Source".

In the analysis of low-carbon steel samples by the combustion infrared absorption method, the analytical value / certification value varies when each is balanced with standard samples with different carbon concentrations.

A balancing test was carried out using a high-carbon steel standard material (JSS 57−6 / C: 0.52%) and a low-carbon steel standard material (JSS 1203−2 / C: 0.0096%) and the two were compared and examined.

It has been found that the analytical values of high-intensity balancing tend to deviate significantly from the true value, while those of low-intensity balancing tend to be close to the true value.

Using low-concentration calibration to analyze samples with extremely low carbon concentrations, good results were obtained in terms of concentration and reproducibility.

The effect of CO2 saturation pressure on nanofoam in the foam forming of supercritical CO2 by the block copolymer of styrene and methacrylic acid perfluorooctyl ethyl (PS-PFMA)  ⁇ 

A thin film of PS-PFMA synthesized by continuous anion superposition was annealed at 60 °C, CO2 saturation pressure of 7.5 to 30 MPa for 1 h, then decompressed at 0 °C, 0.5 MPa/min and foamed.

As a result, CO2 is present in a 10 nm spherical PFMA domain of parent CO2 nature, which serves as a template for foam formation.

The average diameter of the foam cell is 10 to 30 nm, increasing to 20 MPa and then decreasing.

Ellipsometer measurements of PS-PFMA before and after foaming showed that as the CO2 pressure increased, the refractive index decreased and the volume ratio of the foaming cell increased.

Ethanol / cyclohexane 2 is formed by hydrogen bonding on the surface of a glass sphere in a liquid. Ethanol macro-clusters are examined using the 1H-NMR spectroscopy method.

The chemical shifts of protons, mainly OH, CH 2 and CH 3, have been measured in ethanol-concentrated ethanol/heavy hydrogenated cyclohexane 2-component solutions in the absence of glass spheres.

As a result, the spectrum caused by the ethanol molecules in the bulk phase was influenced by the addition of a glass sphere, and the resonance lines of the OH and CH2 protons were broadened and further divided by the addition of a glass sphere at a concentration of about 2 mol% ethanol.

This suggested that when the concentration of ethanol in the glass sphere is high, there are two types of ethanol clusters, and there is an exchange of ethanol molecules between the surface and the bulk clusters.

As part of the development of environmentally friendly catalysts, an inorganic-organic hybrid catalyst was created by fixing organic bases to a variety of regular silicates and examining their catalyst properties.

Here we examined the post-synthesis treatment and organic base modification of the borosilicate type MCM-22 (MWW).

MWW is a zeolite with two independent types of two-dimensional ten-member ring pores and twelve-member ring supercages. The product immediately after crystallization forms a layered precursor, which burns to produce the MWW structure, which is peeled off in layers to expose the supercage, forming a capillary-shaped twelve-member ring pocket on the outer surface.

This pocket area was thought to be the binding site of the organic group and could be used for large substrate reactions.

In addition, it is expected that the catalyst will be further enhanced by the increase of the outer surface by peeling off the layers and by the granulation.

He discovered that it was possible to synthesize urethane using cyclic amines using grade 4 ammonium salts as ionic liquids.

However, with the use of ethyl methyl imidazole tetrafluoro borate and trifluoro methyl sulfonyl imide, the yield of cyclic urethane was only 0 to 16 percent.

Pressure dependence was the highest yield and selectivity at 10 MPa.

Only supercritical carbon dioxide had the same tendency, and the reaction mechanism was estimated to be the same.

It examined the development of a new generation of phenolic compounds as an alternative to fluorine, which are less ozone-depleting and have less impact on global warming.

The implementation and development of the manufacturing technology of two unique types of phenolic compounds with a five-member ring structure (octafluorocyclopentene for semiconductor manufacturing, dry etching, and heptafluorocyclopentene for precision washing solvents).

These compounds are characterized by their lack of ozone depletion and their low impact on global warming.

The technology is characterized by an innovative molecular design that combines environmental compatibility with high performance.

Due to its new and unique molecular structure, which takes advantage of the properties of the five-membered ring, it has high performance corresponding to the cutting-edge field.

The latitude of the 400 to 800 nm wavelength was measured at 2 °C to reveal the mass/length, radius and density of the fibers of the low-temperature induced fibrinogen gel cryogel network.

Fibrinogen molecules come together in rods to form fibrinogen fibers, which are thicker and looser than thrombin-induced fibrin fibers.

In addition, the effects of glucose, mannose, and dextran additives were examined.

With the addition of glucose and mannose, cryogenic gelling was slowed down and a heterogeneous effect was observed.

On the other hand, the addition of dextran promoted low-temperature gelling, the effect of which increased as the molecular weight of dextran increased.

The results obtained with these cryogels are consistent with the results of thrombin-induced fibrillation, which is useful in elucidating the mechanism of cryogenic gelling.

He presented recent advances in the selective synthesis of tertiary alcohols.

He reported on detailed observational experiments and theoretical models of the hardening process aimed at improving the machining accuracy of the optical molding process.

In order to study the growth process of the minimum hardening unit, the exposure time to ultraviolet light was varied and observed.

In this case, the injection light used parallel light so that the light intensity does not change in the direction of progress.

From experiments and theoretical considerations, the growth process became clearer, and a simulation of the hardening growth process was established

If the analysis of the label is possible directly, the operation can be simplified by conventional absorption analysis methods or metaphors.

In this paper, a standard solution of chloride, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfuric acid of each analytical ion species was added to six organic reagents, including sodium nitrate, tartaric acid, and others, and analyzed.

Some could not be analyzed because of the melting time and the melting conditions.

It was also concluded that other organic reagents could be analyzed by taking into account the dissolution time of the main ingredient and setting the dissolution conditions. [1994: 10]

A high-molecular liquid crystal (I) was synthesized by photocomposing 4-(6-acryloylhexylhexyl oxide) resting aromatic acid 4-biphenyl-2 and 2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone as starting agents to synthesize high-molecular liquid crystals (I) and studying their phase transfer behavior.

The liquid crystal monomers were in the pneumatic phase, but I indicated the pneumatic and smectic phases, and their equilibration temperature was higher than that of the monomers.

It was possible to obtain homeotropically oriented I by thermal superposition of liquid crystal monomers and homeotropically oriented origami by optical superposition.

I, photocomposed from 4-(6-methacrylohexyloxy) resting aromatic acid 4-biphenyl, showed the same homeotropic tendency as the liquid crystal monomers

He presented the results of the design of an original lignin material that maximizes the properties of natural lignin and examined its synthesis process.

As a phenolic lignin-derived process, a phase separation process consisting of a concentrated acid-phenol derivative was effective.

It has been found that the molecular weight and phenolic activity of ligno-phenol derivatives can be precisely controlled by the expression of the adjacent base effect on the C β position of the phenol nucleus present in the molecule.

By applying this process, it is possible to synthesize phenolic lignin materials with different properties at high yields and at the same time to supply the constituent carbohydrates as industrial materials in the form of monosaccharides

On November 18, 2000, the Nagasaki University training ship, the Yamagata, was struck by a seismic earthquake.

In this article, we reported on the results of seismic observations.

The earthquake was observed four times in five hours from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m.

It shows the time of the earthquake, its magnitude, the time measured (in seconds), and the magnitude of the earthquake according to the seismic scale.

This observation demonstrated that earthquakes can be transmitted to water depths of more than 5,000 meters.

As a starting point for forming the political will to coordinate and integrate the maritime policies of the coastal countries towards the maritime governance of the Asian sea, a common understanding is needed that the Asian sea also has the geographical characteristics of a semi-closed sea.

Semi-enclosed oceans are extremely vulnerable environmentally and ecologically.

The most difficult to manage is in the sea.

In order to form the political will for integrated management, a new concept called Ocean Governance, Securing the Ocean, has been introduced, aiming at the unification of marine information in all countries.

The integration of information is necessary for effective ocean management policy-making, as pointed out by PEMSEA (Partnership in Enviromental Management for the East Asia).

It is about integrating and coordinating the perceptions of the inhabitants of coastal societies about the oceans and, from there, changing the framework of political decision-making and developing political will.

This report is the result of a survey conducted in 1988.

First of all, in the first chapter, we review the topography, including the seabed of the island of Shinjuku, and the geological and rock features and the history of activity seen from the eruptions, and we try to estimate the underground structure of the island of Shinjuku from artificial earthquakes and the results of electrical exploration.

The second chapter recreated a single eruption in history based on ancient documents.

The third chapter describes the current seismic, geothermal, and volcanic activity of the two islands, based on observations.

According to the results of geological surveys, if an eruption occurs in the future, it is predicted that in the early stages of activity there will be a lot of extremely dangerous volcanic eruptions.

From this position, chapters 4 and 5 provide suggestions for future activity forecasts and based on them for damage assumptions and countermeasures [1990: 5].

He introduced the cooling system developed and used in the Planetary Experiment Laboratory of the Department of Physics at Tokyo University.

An explanation of the separation of He and Ne and an indication of the adsorption-release curve (temperature - emission gas percentage) due to temperature changes.

He also showed the adsorption-release curve for temperature changes of Ar, Kr and Xe.

He also spoke about temperature control.

In order to elucidate the atmospheric-oceanic exchange of carbon dioxide, a survey of the labels was carried out on August 2-3, 1994.

A discontinuous line of seawater carbon dioxide decomposition pressure was found near the boundaries of each sea area.

This was thought to be due to the presence of smaller bodies of water with horizontal movement and vertical mixing, with their own carbon cycles operated by biological activity.

The maintenance and preservation of the water environment is an essential challenge for the conservation of wetlands, and when taking conservation measures, it is necessary to disclose the water resources of the wetlands.

In it, the authors examined the Aoyama Valley wetlands and examined the results of measurements of water runoff from the wetlands and the water balance of the wetlands from meteorological data.

As a result, it was found that much of the lost rainfall was due to evaporation, and that the 1994 flood changed the drainage characteristics of the wetlands.

When the sea wind blows from the sea to the land, the difference in temperature between the land surface (high temperature) and the sea surface (low temperature) creates an area of rich convection mixture on the land called the thermal inner boundary layer (TIBL).

When TIBL is developing, if there is a source of smoke at sea or near the coast from which pollutants are emitted, its propagation process is interfered with by TIBL and high concentrations appear near the surface of the earth.

The atmospheric diffusion phenomenon of pollutants taking into account this TIBL was reproduced using a wind tunnel and compared with the results of numerical calculations and field observations.

As a result, I learned to show good unity.
