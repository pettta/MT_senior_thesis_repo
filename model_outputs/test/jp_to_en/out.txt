Volume 3 consists of 102 chapters .

Volume 4 consists of 32 chapters .

Volume 5 might have been lost .

It takes Ruisan form .

There exists only one manuscript that has been handed down in the Maeda family of Kaga Province ( the book collection of MAEDA-Ikutokukai ) .

It is preserved in a box of gold-lacquered craft , and on its surface are the characters " 清少納言枕草子 ( Sei Shonagon , The Pillow Book ) " in gold incrustation .

It is an important cultural property .

It was copied during the early Kamakura period and is considered to be the oldest of all the manuscripts of " The Pillow Book . "

Among them , the Sakaibon group Gokogoninbon was separately collected in two volumes of " Gunshoruiju ( Japanese history book ) , " and three kinds of Sakaibon were collected in " Shinko Gunshoruiju ( library ) . "

Additionally , Noinbon was used as a master copy in making the old plate of type in the early Edo period ; therefore , it remained a dominant manuscript along with " The Pillow Book Bochu ( marginal notes ) " and " Shunsho-sho Commentary of The Pillow Book " ( annotated by Kigin KITAMURA ) until modern times .

However , in 1946 , when Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917-1987 ) reevaluated the second class of Sankanbon , it came to be considered more important and was published more , being used as a textbook and read at school after the war .

Other existent manuscripts are seven chapters of " The Pillow Book Ekotoba ( story in pictures ) " made in the late Kamakura period , consisting of emaki ( a picture scroll ) with hakubyoga ( ink line painting ) , and Sankanbon manuscript seems to have been used for the notes .

The second-class Sankanbon contains more than 300 independent chapters in total .

It consists of various types of writing : ' chapters of Ruiju ' of ' Monowazukushi ( enumerating the things in the same category ) , ' as represented by the lists of things like ' Insects , ' ' Flowering trees , ' ' Dispiriting things , ' ' Endearingly lovely things , ' and ' Chapters of Zuiso ( essay ) , ' which is an observation of daily life and nature in the seasons , and ' chapters of reminiscence ( chapters of a diary ) ' in which the author wrote about the life around Empress Teishi , whom she served in the Imperial Court .

However , some chapters are too obscure to be classified ( for example the first chapter , entitled , ' The best time in spring is dawn , ' is generally classified into the chapters of Zuiso , but some people disagree ) .

It was written in the plain vernacular using Hiragana ( the Japanese cursive syllabary ) , and most of the chapters were written in a witty style , but sometimes sentimental lamentation appears reflecting the fall of the Michitaka FUJIWARA 's family and unhappiness gone through by her majesty Empress Teishi .

The author 's sophisticated taste was in harmony with a keen observation on things , generating the intellectual aesthetic world of ' wokashi ( amusing or delightful ) ' in contrast with the emotional ' mono no aware ( pathos ) ' of " The Tale of Genji . "

Positive evaluation

In The Pillow Book , the author cherished humanity as well as nature ; therefore , she accepted and formed them in each phase as various beauties ( Sakuwo MEKATA ) .

Even in each chapter , various types of rich writing such as lists , essays or reminiscences are freely interwoven , like a flying horse soaring into the sky with a strand of associations called up one after another . ( Boku HAGITANI )

Although it followed the conventional ' spring - flower -morning ' type of link that was often seen in Kokinshu in those days , its use of the ' season-time ' type of expression ( such as ' the best time in spring is dawn ' ) , which omitted the middle poetic element , was innovative , challenging as it did the rigid esthetic values held by readers who were familiar with poetic traditions . ( Munetoshi FUJIMOTO )

She expressed her love and respect for Empress Teishi .

The author wrote it to console Empress Teishi , who felt depressed over the fall of the Michitaka family .

Therefore , it is natural that she didn 't mention the fall of the Michitaka family ( as above ) .

There are some chapters that seem like mere self-praise , but in them the author claimed that the Empress and the people around her received the Emperor 's favor and led a life filled with aesthetic sentiment and exquisite taste , living in a world that was cut off from the politics of the time and disappointment . ( Osamu UENO ) .

Negative evaluation

It is a representation of her shallowness trying to forget her original social rank and assimilate herself to the upper class . ( Ken AKIYAMA )

( It is based on the fact that she didn 't use polite expressions when she wrote , not only about her family but also about those who belonged to the upper classes . )

It is only ' a record of civilization in the inner palace , ' and wasn 't written by ' a private individual ' ( Joji ISHIDA ) .

Yoshinobu ( Yoshihisa ) TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun of the Edo Shogunate ( held the position from December 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 , both in the old lunar calendar ) .

He was the only Shogun who did not work in Edo-jo Castle .

His rank awarded by the Imperial Court was Naidaijin ( Inner Minister ) Ju-ichii Kun-itto Koshaku .

He was a member of the House of Peers of Japan .

He served as the guardian ( Shogun Kokenshoku ) of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA ; after Iemochi 's death he assumed his position as the 15th Shogun of the Edo Shogunate .

After he returned his right to administer government to Emperor Meiji ( Taisei Hokan ) , he worked aiming to unite the nobles and samurai ( Kobu Gattai ) ; however , during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi that took place after the Restoration of Imperial Rule ( Osei Fukko ) , he left the Shogunate army behind at Osaka-jo Castle and returned to Edo-jo Castle ; thereafter , he received a subjugation order from the Imperial Court and entered into disciplinary confinement which led to the Bloodless Surrender of Edo-jo Castle .

After being freed from the disciplinary confinement , he immersed himself in his hobbies ; he was awarded the title of Koshaku and lived into the Taisho Period .

The name " Yoshinobu " is also popularly read as " Keiki " ( Yusoku-yomi , the way of pronouncing in the Chinese-derived reading , so as not to directly pronounce the real name of the respectable person in the Japanese reading ) .

There is a record among official documents of the Edo Shogunate that during his tenure as the Shogun his name was also read as " Yoshihisa " .

There are also records of his name written as " Yoshihisa " with his own signature using Roman letters , and [ his name printed as " Yoshihisa " ] in newspapers in English .

He is most often called " Yoshinobu " in his homeland of Mito , but he is often called " Keiki " in Shizuoka , where he spent the rest of his life .

According to those who knew him in his lifetime , Yoshinobu himself liked to be called " Keiki-sama " , and he called himself " Keiki " in a telegraph sent to his younger brother , Akitake TOKUGAWA .

Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was Yoshinobu 's heir , was also called " Keikyu-sama " from those around him .

The use of the two names " Keiki-sama " and " Keiki-san " has been confirmed , and even though it seems to have become uncommon in the modern days , the use of " Keiki-san " is not limited to Shizuoka but is confirmed in various regions ; in both cases the name is often used with much affection .

Though Ryotaro SHIBA commented that " the name ' Keiki ' was used quite often among those associated with the former Shogunate " , the use of the name " Keiki " was also confirmed among those related to Higo-han Clan who worked toward the fall of the Shogunate ; there is a possibility that he was widely yet secretly respected and admired .

He was born at the Mito-han Clan residence of Koishikawa in Edo , as the seventh son of the ninth chief [ of Mito-han Clan ] , Nariaki TOKUGAWA on September 29 , 1837 .

His mother was [ his father 's ] legitimate wife , Princess Yoshiko ( he was the first Shogun since the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA whose biological mother was the father 's legitimate wife .

However , although Iemitsu 's biological mother is officially known as the father Hidetada 's legitimate wife , Ogo no Kata , but one theory suggests that his biological mother was Kasuga no Tsubone ) .

His childhood name was Shichiromaro .

Based on Nariaki 's educational policy , " a boy should be educated in his home domain " Yoshinobu moved to Mito at the age of seven months and spent most of his time there until he succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family , during which time he was educated and taught martial arts by Seishisai AIZAWA .

Yoshinobu 's intelligence was noted early ; at first , instead of sending him to another family for adoption , Nariaki planned to keep him by his eldest son and heir , Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA 's side .

On August 1 , 1847 , the Shogunate gave a secret order to designate Shichiromaro of Mito-han Clan as the heir to the Hitotsubashi Family , one of the three branches of the Tokugawa-han Clan ( Gosankyo ) .

Accepting this order , Shichiromaro succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Family on September 1 ; in December , he received Henki ( one character of Shogun 's name : 慶 ) from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi ( 家慶 ) TOKUGAWA and changed his name to Yoshinobu ( 慶喜 ) .

Considering Yoshinobu as a strong candidate as the heir to the Shogun , Ieyoshi visited the Hitotsubashi Residence often , but he abandoned this idea after accepting Roju Masahiro ABE 's admonishing advice .

During the disorder caused by the Arrival of the Black Ships , Shogun Ieyoshi died in 1853 ; his heir , the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA , had poor health with no prospect of having his own son , and therefore the issue of " who would become the Shogun 's heir " arose ( Issue of Shogun 's Heir ) .

There was an opposition between the Hitotsubashi-party that included Nariaki , Masahiro ABE and the Chief of Satsuma-han Clan , Nariakira SHIMAZU , who recommended Yoshinobu , and the Nanki-party primarily consisting of the Chief of Hikone-han Clan , Naosuke II , and the Ooku members headed by Iesada 's birth-mother , Honjuin , who recommended the Chief of Kii-han Clan , Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA .

The Hitotsubashi-party executed political maneuvers such as sending into Ooku Nariakira SHIMAZU 's adopted daughter , Tenshoin , as Shogun 's wife ( Midaidokoro ) , but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU , its power weakened ; Naosuke II who became Tairo in 1858 settled on " Shogun 's heir as Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA " through arbitration .

In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without the Emperor 's permission .

Yoshinobu , along with Nariaki and the Chief of Fukui-han Clan , Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , made an unexpected visit to the [ Edo-jo ] castle and closely interrogated Naosuke , but in tern , he was questioned on his offense of making an unexpected visit to the castle ; he was ordered to retire and was given a disciplinary confinement in the following year ( 1859 ) ( Ansei Purge ) .

Yoshinobu himself seemed to be uninterested in becoming the heir to the Shogun and he sent a letter to Nariaki whose content indicated " I appreciate your efforts but I 'd rather not become the Shogun than to make mistakes after becoming the Shogun . "

He was relieved from his disciplinary confinement in 1860 .

In 1862 , guarded by the Satsuma-han Clan army under the command of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , the Emperor 's messenger , Shigetomi OHARA , entered Edo and delivered Emperor Komei 's order to " promote Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA to the Shogun 's guardian ( Shogun Kokenshoku ) and Shungaku ( Yoshinaga ) MATSUDAIRA to Tairo . "

On July 6 , the Shogunate ordered Yoshinobu to be the Shogun 's guardian ( Shogun Kokenshoku ) and Shungaku to be the Shogunal Prime Minister ( Seiji Sosaishoku ) .

Yoshinobu and Shungaku directed a reform of the Shogunate known as the Bunkyu Reform that included installation of The Office of Kyoto Protector ( Kyoto Shugoshoku ) and relaxation of Sankin Kotai requirement .

In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as Iemochi TOKUGAWA 's harbinger , and he endeavored to negotiate with the members of the Imperial Court who urged the execution of Joi ( expulsion of foreigners from Japan ) .

Upon Emperor Komei 's visit to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the execution of Joi , if Iemochi received Setto ( Emperor 's sword that symbolically authorizes the Shogun to take charge of the upcoming battle on behalf of the Emperor ) from the Emperor , he would have no choice but to execute Joi ; Yoshinobu quickly made Iemochi cancel the audience [ with the Emperor ] by saying that Iemochi had a cold and a fever ( pretended illness ) .

When the Sonno Joi party ( the anti-foreigner Royalists ) centered around the Choshu-han Clan lost their case upon the political change on August 18 , Yoshinobu went to Kyoto again in order to participate in a meeting jointly held by the party trying to unite the nobles and samurai ( Kobu Gattai ) and the party assisting the Shogunate ( Sabaku ) .

However , when no agreement was reached , he used a bold method of negotiation ; he intentionally got drunk at a banquet with Prince Kuni Asahiko and reviled at Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and furthermore , violently said to Nakagawa no Miya , " how much is SHIMAZU paying you ! " so as to breakdown their organization .

Thereafter , he remained in Kyoto and he was appointed to Kinri Goshuei Sotoku ( Head of the Imperial Palace / Emperor 's Protector ) ; together with the Protector ( Shugoshoku ) Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( Aizu-han Clan ) and Kyoto Shoshidai Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( Chief of Kuwana-han Clan ) regulated the nobles and those loyal to the Emperor ( Ichi-Kai-So ( Hitotsubashi-Aizu-Kuwana ) structure ) .

During the Tenguto War he showed his cruelty by slashing his supporters such as Kounsai TAKEDA and the vassals of his home domain of Mito .

At the Kinmon Rebellion in 1864 he led the Shogunate army and he himself attacked the Choshu army that had occupied the Takatsukasa Residence .

After the First Subjugation of Choshu that followed , he made every effort to secure the Emperor 's permission on the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the Unites States and Japan that had been left unauthorized by the Emperor ; he succeeded in securing the Emperor 's authorization albeit with provisos .

At the Second Subjugation of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu suppressed interferences from Satsuma-han Clan and received a direct order from the Emperor to subjugate Choshu .

However , because of the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance ( Saccho Alliance ) , Satsuma-han Clan refused to send its army and consequently the Shogunate army had to retreat .

During the Second Subjugation of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi passed away at Osaka-jo Castle on July 20 .

Yoshinobu appealed to the Imperial Court to make an official announcement of truce by the Emperor and he succeeded in concluding an armistice treaty .

He was recommended to be Iemochi 's successor but Yoshinobu firmly declined .

He succeeded to the Tokugawa Shogun Family on Aug . 20 but he continued to refuse to assume his position as the Shogun .

Since then the roju ( Shogun 's political advisor ) and others sincerely requested him to become the Shogun , but he still did not accept the request ; he finally assumed his position as the Shogun on December 5 , after accepting ( Emperor Komei 's ) direct order to become the Shogun .

By becoming the Shogun as a favor to others he aimed to manipulate politics to his advantage .

Through the French Minister Leon Roches , he received 2.4 million dollars from France and founded Yokosuka Ironworks , a shipyard , and a ship repair dock , and he also led a revolution in the military system by inviting a group of military advisors headed by Jules Brunet .

He also sent his biological younger brother , Akitake TOKUGAWA , to the Paris Exposition and encouraged the younger members of the Shogunate vassals to study in Europe .

On the matter of opening of port of Hyogo , he tenaciously persuaded the Imperial Court and obtained the Emperor 's permission .

Yoshinobu anticipated a secret order to Saccho ( Satsuma and Choshu -han Clans ) from the Emperor to destroy the Shogunate , and on Oct . 14 , 1867 , he ( as a preemptive measure ) suggested to the Imperial Court that he would return his political power to the Emperor ; his request was accepted by the Emperor on the 15th , the following day ( Taisei Hokan ) .

It is said that he judged the Imperial Court at the time to have no capability to administer government , and he therefore sought continuation of Tokugawa Family 's political power by leading the Session of Clan Chiefs .

However , because of the anti-Shogunate activists Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA 's scheme , there was a command to revive the political power of the Imperial Court in December , and Yoshinobu was ordered " Jikan Nochi " ( to resign from his position as Naidaijin and surrender the Tokugawa territory ) .

In order to avoid confrontations Yoshinobu retreated to Osaka-jo Castle , assembled the ambassadors from various foreign countries and asserted the legitimacy of Tokugawa ; furthermore , he appealed to the Imperial Court and had the Jikan Nochi modified to more moderate terms .

However , in response to the provocation caused by Satsuma-han Clan in the city of Edo in 1868 he mobilized his army and blockaded Kyoto using the armies of Aizu and Kuwana-han Clans .

Nevertheless , at the Battle of Toba Fushimi that broke out on January 3 , even though the military force was holding up adequately , he judged that the former Shogunate army was at a disadvantage ; he abandoned his army and retreated to Edo-jo Castle aboard warship Kaiyo Maru .

Soon an order was issued to subjugate Yoshinobu as the enemy of the Imperial Court , and the Imperial Army led by General Prince Arisugawa Taruhito set off to the east .

Yoshinobu suppressed the resistance party led by Tadamasa OGURI and asserted to comply with the order .

In February , he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to take control of the situation and entered into a disciplinary confinement at Daiji-in located in Kan 'ei-ji Temple in Ueno .

Furthermore , he passed on the estate of Tokugawa-Soke ( the main branch of Tokugawa Family ) to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU ( future Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .

The negotiation between Katsu and the Staff Officer of the Imperial Army , Takamori SAIGO , reached an agreement and Bloodless Surrender of Edo-jo Castle took place ; Yoshinobu was moved to Mito and he continued his disciplinary confinement in a room within Kodokan of [ Mito ] Han ( Domain ) School .

In July , [ the entire ] Tokugawa family was relocated to Sunpu .

He was allowed to officially establish Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( Koshaku ) Family aside from the main branch of the Tokugawa Family .

He was a member of House of Peers ( Japan ) ( ~ December , 1910 )

1908

On April 30 , his contributions to Taisei Hokan were recognized and he was awarded Kun-itto Kyokujitsu Daijusho from the Meiji Government .

He retired on December 8 .

He died ( at 4 : 10 A.M. ) on November , 22 , 1913 .

On the same day , he was awarded Kyokujitsu Toka Daijusho .

As far as education and studying of martial arts are concerned , he was born and raised under the very best circumstance ; among many forms of martial arts he was especially interested in and was an expert in shuriken ( dirk-throwing ) .

Even after Taisei Hokan , he practiced throwing the shuriken every day until he was sweating , and he is counted as one of the most famous persons among the shuriken experts .

He tossed about a lot in bed in his sleep , and his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , thought that this would be a problem when he became the heir to the Tokugawa Family ; in order to correct this , razor blades were planted into his pillow ( this was done just to scare him , and in reality the razor blades were removed after he had fallen asleep so as to prevent any injuries ) .

On the other hand , there is an anecdote that in his adulthood he slept with his wife and a concubine so that the three of them formed the letter " Y " as a measure against assassination attempts .

There is supposed to be a photograph of Yoshinobu from his early childhood , but because cameras were probably not yet introduced to Japan at that time , it is doubtful that the photograph is that of Yoshinobu .

Yoshinobu visited Iemochi when he fell ill , and at this occasion it is said that they had a normal conversation .

His extraordinary talent was well known , and his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA 's confidant , Tatewaki AJIMA , commented on him as " someone who will purify the Tokugawa Family line " ; he singly shouldered the expectation of restoring the Shogunate 's authority , and when his highly touted tenure as the Shogun began , his brilliance was praised as " the return of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA " .

Yoshinobu 's intelligence was well known even among the Anti-Shogunate Party , and Takayoshi KIDO of Choshu-han Clan in particular was on guard saying , " Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI 's daring and intelligent strategy cannot be underestimated .

It is like seeing the return of Ieyasu . "

Regarding the decision on Taisei Hokan , Ryoma SAKAMOTO said , " My respected Shogun , I wonder what you are feeling in your heart today .

I praise how you made the [ difficult ] decision , I praise how you made the [ difficult ] decision .

I make a vow to dedicate my life to the Lord . " Ryoma highly praised Yoshinobu and he even considered giving Yoshinobu a position as Assistant Kanpaku in the New Government .

However , Yoshinobu did not learn about the existence of Ryoma until the Meiji era ( after Ryoma 's death ) .

Yoshinobu was not the only person who did not know about Ryoma ; Ryoma 's fame in his life time was very much smaller than that after the Meiji Restoration .

When he lost the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and retreated to Edo , his enemies highly criticized him for " running away in the face of the enemy " .

There were people who made fun of Yoshinobu for being a spineless coward , pointing out that even though he left behind Ieyasu 's umajirushi ( sign belonging to the clan general / chief and used in a battle ) of golden fan , he always had his beloved concubine with him .

However , there is a view that Yoshinobu had no choice [ but to retreat ] because at that time it was necessary to suppress military revolts in Edo as well as in Musashi Province , and because Yoshinobu became the Imperial Court 's enemy , various clans were alienating themselves one after another from the Shogunate ; thus , even if he was able to protect Osaka-jo Castle , a long-term battle had to be avoided in order to prevent interventions from foreign countries .

Because he entered Kan 'ei-ji Temple for disciplinary confinement as soon as the New Government designated him as the Imperial Court 's enemy , he was considered as a reasonable man who respected the Emperor and the Imperial Court ( perhaps this was due to the teaching of Mito-han [ Clan ] that highly respected the Emperor and also to the fact that his mother was from the Imperial Family ) ; however , on the other hand , he was also called weak-kneed because as the lord of his people , he was not able to stand resolutely in the face of the enemy .

Because of his compliance with the disciplinary confinement and the Bloodless Transfer of Edo-jo Castle , the administrative power was transferred as a result of almost a bloodless revolution ; he contributed greatly to the Restoration and ensuring of independency of modern Japan .

Businessman Eiichi SHIBUSAWA was a vassal appointed during [ Yoshinobu 's ] tenure as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family , and they kept their contact even after the Meiji Restoration .

In Yoshinobu 's last years , SHIBUSAWA aimed to edit Yoshinobu 's biography ; he persuaded unwilling Yoshinobu and started " Sekimukai " meetings to hear stories directly from Yoshinobu .

A collection of these stories is called " Sekimukai Hikki " .

In one of the chapters which was recorded in the form of a discussion , one can see what Yoshinobu 's voice , so to speak , was like .

He used his age as an excuse to evade unpalatable questions and he let out his true feelings by saying , " I didn 't really like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU " and " Naomasa NABESHIMA was a cunning fellow " ; from these comments , one can see his personality and what he was feeling at that time .

After Yoshinobu 's death " Tokugawa Yoshinobu-ko Den " was completed based on these materials .

In order to show his gratitude to Emperor Meiji who pardoned Yoshinobu from being the enemy of the Imperial Court and gave him the title of Koshaku , the highest rank of the peers , Yoshinobu directed in his will that his funeral be conducted in the Shinto style rather than the Buddhist style .

Therefore , Yoshinobu 's grave is neither in the Tokugawa Family graveyard of his family temple Zojo-ji Temple or the Tokugawa Family graveyard at Kan 'ei-ji Temple ; instead , a tumulus similar to that of the Imperial Family was built in Yanaka Cemetery .

He did so because he was moved by the fact that Emperor Komei 's tomb was very simple ( " Tokugawa Yoshinobu-ko Den " ) .

After his pardon , Yoshinobu enjoyed a relaxed life without any regards to his former vassals who devoted their lives to him ; on this , Roju Katsukiyo ITAKURA later commented , " I regret working together with Yoshinobu " .

Even though he has an image of being a spineless coward , because he " ran away in the face of his enemy " during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , there has recently been a focus on his attempt at constructing a new , modern political system after Taisei Hokan , and there is a movement to re-evaluate his contributions including airing of " TOKUGAWA Yoshinobu " ( an NHK Taiga Drama ) .

As with his father , Nariaki , he liked pork from Satsuma-han Clan and he was called Butaichi-sama ( meaning Hitotsubashi-sama who likes pork ) .

He was interested in items of western culture , and in his later years he liked to eat bread and drink milk and he enjoyed his interests in photography , fishing , riding the bicycle , microscopy and craft ( embroidery ) . During his tenure as the Shogun , he learned French from Amane NISHI but he gave up on this .

He was well know as a photographer , but his techniques in photography seemed to have been mediocre .

He often submitted his photographs to photography magazines , but his photographs were hardly ever printed in the magazines .

His great grandchild , Yoshitomo TOKUGAWA , is a freelance photographer ; he discovered photographs stored in the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family including the ones taken by Yoshinobu and he published the photo album after organizing and editing them .

Yoshinobu 's biological younger brother , Akitake TOKUGAWA , was his friend who shared his hobbies in his life .

He married Mikako ICHIJO ( name changed to Mikako after the Meiji Restoration ) on December 3 , 1855 .

The first daughter ( Keikoin ) between Mika was born on July 16 , 1858 but she soon died on July 20 .

Afterwards , there were no more children between Mika ; the 10 boys and 11 girls born during the Meiji era were children born between his two concubines .

Some of these children include the seventh son , Yoshihisa , who became a Koshaku and succeeded to the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family , tenth son , Kuwashi , who married into Kaishu KATSU 's family and ninth daughter , Tsuneko , who became Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu .

Some of Yoshihisa 's children include Yoshimitsu TOKUGAWA and Princess Kikuko who married Prince Takamatsu Nobuhito .

Notes

The JR Nara Line is a railway line ( arterial line ) of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) that runs between Kizu Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) in Kizugawa City , Kyoto Prefecture , and Kyoto Station in the Shimogyo Ward of Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .

The entire rail line is included in the section covering the metropolitan area and its suburbs .

Although the Nara Line officially starts at Kizu Station because it is historically a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , outbound trains ( odd-numbered trains ) run from Kyoto to Kizu and inbound trains ( even-numbered trains ) run in the opposite direction .

Unless otherwise specified , the descriptions are given according to the outbound direction from Kyoto to Kizu , except for in the track data section .

The line 's own color is brown , which has been chosen to represent ' a classic , sophisticated impression suitable for connections between two historic cities . '

Administration ( type of business ) : West Japan Railway Company ( Railway Business Operator )

Track length ( operating kilometers ) : 34.7 km

Track gauge : 1067 mm

Number of stations : 19 ( including the stations at both ends of the track section )

Double-track section : Shinden Station - Uji Station ; JR-Fujinomori Station - Kyoto Station

Electrified section : The entire rail line is electrified ( DC 1500V ) .

Block ( railway ) : automatic block system ( double-track section ) , single-track automatic block system ( single-track section )

Safety equipment : ATS ( Automatic Train Stop system )

Operation direction center : Shin-Osaka integrated direction center

Maximum speed : 110 km / h ( double-track section ) , 95 km / h ( single-track section )

All stations except Kizu Station are managed by the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company , while the Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka branch of the West Japan Railway Company .

The line between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station is called the Nara Line , but the entire line lies within Kyoto Prefecture , not in Nara Prefecture .

This is because , initially , the Nara Line was built by Nara Railways between Kyoto Station and Nara Station , but Kizu Station and other stations south of Kizu Station were separated from the Nara Line in order to be part of a route between Osaka and Nagoya after Nara Railways was merged into Kansai Railways .

However , trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture through the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) .

JR West established popular names ( JR Kyoto Line , JR Kobe Line or the like ) for the lines in the Urban Network with the revision of March 13 , 1988 , but a popular name was not given to the Nara Line .

The Nara Line is also referred to as the ' JR Nara Line ' in order to distinguish it from the Kintetsu Nara Line of Kintetsu Corporation .

The Nara Line was referred to as the ' JNR Nara Line ' in the era of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) , the former JR , and the information board included the English notation ' JNR . '

The Kintetsu Nara Line competes with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara , whereas the JR Nara Line competes with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line .

While many trains used to run on the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line ( both of which run parallel to the Nara Line ) , the Nara Line was only electrified toward the end of JNR in 1984 ; consequently , it remained just a small local line on which the JNR / JR Commuter Train Series 105 ( comprising two cars or the like ) ran for some time , even after electrification , until the privatization of the JNR .

However , after the foundation of JR West and the Nara Line 's incorporation into the Urban Network , the improvement of transportation services was quickly achieved with , for example , trains comprised of four cars ( some comprised of six cars ) , double-tracked in part , or with increased numbers of trains , including rapid services such as the ' Miyakoji Rapid Service . '

Today , the Nara Line is characterized by the access it offers to sightseeing areas such as Byodo-in Temple in Uji City , or by a commuter line for passengers from the southern part of the Kyoto Prefecture , such as Joyo City .

However , trains go around toward the east between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station and run the edge of the central part of town in Joyo or to the south of Joyo ; thus the regional and transportation gaps between the Nara Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line remain .

Rolling stock owned by the Osaka branch for the Nara rail yard is used , but station facilities are maintained by the Kyoto branch ( except for Kizu Station ) .

The following commuter passes can be used at all stations on this line : J-THRU / ICOCA ; Suica , which is offered by the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) ; TOICA , which is offered by the Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) ; and PiTaPa , which is offered by the Surutto Kansai Association .

Simple ticket gates are used at Joyo Station or stations to the south of Joyo Station , as some unmanned stations still exist .

After the limited express ' Kuroshio ' connecting Kyoto Station with Wakayama Station via the Nara , Sakurai and Wakayama lines ceased operation in 1984 , only the local trains ran until 1991 ( except for the temporary operation of a special limited express ) , but now there are four types of trains : the Miyakoji Rapid Service , the rapid service , the trains classified by operation and section , and the local train .

The Miyakoji Rapid Service--the fastest train on the Nara Line--runs mainly during the day .

The train basically runs every 30 minutes and variously connects with the local trains at Uji Station .

The public gave this train the nickname ' Miyakoji rapid train ' before it went into operation .

Not only Japanese people but also foreign visitors use the Miyakoji Rapid Service as a train connecting Kyoto with Nara , both of which are sightseeing destinations .

The cars are all from the JR Suburban Train Series 221 , which comprises either four or six cars .

The maximum train speed is 110 km / h in double-track sections , or 95 km / h in other sections .

The standard travel times are approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto to Nara and about 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto .

A train bound for Kyoto stops at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for about two minutes and passes the Miyakoji Rapid Service bound for Nara , thus making a slight difference between the travel times of the inbound train and outbound train .

During the New Year holiday the train temporarily stops at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine .

History

March 3 , 2001 : Operations began .

March 15 , 2003 : The train began making stops at Tofuku-ji Station and Tamamizu Station through a revision of the schedule .

The rapid service runs during the morning and evening rush periods .

It stops at JR-Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) , through which the ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' passes .

The cars used are all from the JR Suburban Train Series 221 , which comprises either four or six cars .

The train basically runs every 30 minutes and variously connects with the local train at the Uji Station .

Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service , the rapid service passes through Narayama Station , at which the rapid train on the Yamatoji Line stops .

Before the ' Miyakoji rapid train ' came into operation in March 2001 , the rapid train had stopped at Kyoto , Uji , Joyo ( except at the beginning ) , Kizu and Nara stations , employing the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 for its cars ; since then , however , this series has not been used on the Nara Line .

Some rapid service trains run through to the Yamatoji Line in the morning and evening due to the schedule of operation .

The regional rapid service runs mainly in the morning and nighttime hours .

It   is   curious   how  the   media   doesn't   explain  exactly  what   is   the difference   between   Japan   and   the   US   and   countries  like   China   and   Russia ,  even  though   the answer   is   right   there .

P . S :  also  the   one   who dropped  white  powder  in   front   of  the  police   officer

A  testimony   of  sexual   and   workplace   harassment   during   Ach ū's time at   Dentsu .

Case   (   71 - year -old ,   woman  )   became  hospitalization ,   since   pain   of   left   inguinal   region  circumference   is  exacerbated .

Base   on  preoperative  diagnosis   of  malignant lymphoma ,  incision  biopsy  method   were   enforced .

In   pathohistological   view,  malignant   peripheral   nerve   schwannoma   ( MPNST ) ,   PENT ,   and  synovial  sarcoma   were   mentioned in  differential  diagnosis .

And   NK / Tcell lymphoma   was  strongly  suspected in  analysis   of   surface   marker .

In   addition ,   the  fusion   gene   was  searched ,   and  it   was  finally diagnosed  as  synovial  sarcoma .

Still ,   the  immunostaining   support diagnosis   is  useful   for   MPNST ,   PENT   and  synovial  sarcoma   of differential  diagnosis .

The  case   was  in   a   52 - year -old   woman   with  swallowing   difficulty  and   backache as  the   chief  complaints ,   and  it   was  diagnosed  as   progressive   stage   esophageal   cancer   from   the   result   of  thorax   CT   and   upper  digestive   tract  endoscopic  examination .

Morphinic   suppository   was   started   for   the   pain ,   and   the  simultaneous   combination  therapy  of   radio chemotherapy   u sing   cisplatin   and   fluorouracil  was   performed .

After  the   pain  was  strengthened ,  the   pain  treatment   was  reinforced   by   changing   to  fentanyl  patch  and  morphine  hydrochloride  continuous   subcutaneous  injection .

The  delirium  appeared  as   a  slight symptom,  but  severe  unrest   did   not   appear ,   and  it  could   be   dealt   with   regular   administration   of   chlorpromazine  hydrochloride  and   extraordinal   small   flunitrazepam   administration .

The drugs used  in   pain  treatment  and   for   securing   sleep  seemed to   have   caused   the  delirium ,   and  it   was   possible  to   reduce  the  complaint   for   pain  and  maintain  good   QOL   as   a   result   of   strengthening   the  treatment   for   the  delirium .

The  history   of   research   on  the  etiology  of   Parkinson disease   is   viewed .

Knowledge  on  the   mitochondrial   damage  and  oxidative   damage  in   Parkinson disease  are   introduced ,   and   crisis   mechanism  of  the   Parkinson disease   is   discus sed .

And ,   crisis   of  the   Parkinson disease   is   caught   from   genetic   viewpoint ,   and   a knowledge  on  the discovery   of   cause   gene   Parkin   of  the kinship  Parkinson disease  and   the  function ,   and   mis folding   and   aggregation   of  the   protein  are   introduced .

A knowledge  by   the   present   on  the  cause   gene   of  other   kinship  Parkinson disease   is   also  shown,   and   future  prospect   on  the   research   of  the  etiology  of  the   Parkinson disease   is   also mentioned .

Conventional  un derstanding   for   the  conformation  and   position   of   rectum   lateral   ligament  are   described .

It   is   explained  that   the un derstanding   for   lateral   ligament   from   the  viewpoint   of  the   whole  body   is  important .

It   is  indicated  that   the   fascia  becomes an  index  to  the  component   of  the   whole  body .

Features  of  the  basic   configuration  and   fascia  intrapelvina  composition   of   fascia  subperitonealis   are   outlined .

Features  of  the   rectum  in  the   pelvis  and   relationship  between   rectum  and   fascia  are   explained .

The  cause  and   the  solution   for   troubles  occurred  during   immunostaining   were   shown .

Examples  of   troubles are   1 )   that  it   was  difficult   to  confirm target  cells   as  erythrocytes   were   also stained ,   2 )   that   the  degree   of  staining   was  different   in   places ,   and   3 )   that   colored  dirt   of   DAB   was  conspicuous .

As   a   solution   method   for   ( 1 ) ,   processing   of endogenous   peroxidases was  examined .

There   are   three  block   approaches  for  endogenous   peroxidases:   first   approach   is   to  oxidize  them  with   0 . 5 〜 1 %   periodic   acid  for   10  minutes ,  second   one   is   to  oxidize  them  with   methanol   added  by   0 . 3 %   hydrogen   peroxide   for   10  minute  at   room temperature  and   third   is   to  oxidize  them  with   methanol   added  by   3 %   hydrogen   peroxide   for   10  minute  at   room temperature .

In   case   of   ( 2 ) ,   the  trouble   was   caused   by   the  fact  that   the   reaction   box   was tilted and   concentration difference   of  the antibody   was   developed in  the  right   and   left   sides .

In   case   ( 3 ) ,   the  color   of   DAB   was   recognized  on  the slide  glass  and   this   colored  dirt  seemed to   be   developed  by   dehydration  during  staining   operation .

Femoral   fractures   by   the looseness   of  the stem  after   THA   and   FHR   is   one   of  the  important   complications .

This  time,   we  treated   5   cases in   Vancouver   classification type   B 2 ,  B 3   fracture .

They  are   1   case   of   open   reduction   fixing   by  Dall - Mailes  system ,   1   case   of  cement   replacement  with   the  impaction   bone grafting   method ,   2   cases  of  cement   replacement   u sing   the  long   stem  with   two  method  and   1   case   of   replacement   by  distance   fixing type  cementless  long   stem .

The coalitio   was  obtained in   4   cases in   postoperative   3   months ,   and   radiolucent   line   and   migration   were   not   recognized .

The   results indicated  that   replacement   u sing   the stem  combined  with   two  method   was  necessary   for  stability   of  the   fracture  and   the stem  and   recovery   of  the  bone  quantity .

The   keratitis   caused   by   herpes  simplex  virus   of types   1   and   2   ( HSV - 1 , 2 )   is   called   herpetic   keratits .

It   is   classified  into  epithelial type ,   parenchymal type and  endothelial type ,   with  mainly  dendritic   keratitis   and   map - like  keratitis   in  epithelial type ,   disc - like  keratitis   and   necrotic   keratitis   in   parenchymal type and  corneal  endotheliosis   in  endothelial type .

For   this   disease ,   the disease   state ,  symptoms  and  findings ,   test   methods  and   test   values  useful   for   the diagnosis ,  diagnostic   criteria   and   diagnosis ,  differentiating   diagnosis ,   therapy ,   prognosis   and   explanation  to  the   patient  are   outlined .

Keratitis   is   generated  not   only  by   HSV ,  but  also  by   chickenpox - herpes zoster   virus   ( VZV ) .

The   keratitis   by   VZV   is   also   outlined .

Drugs used   for   the  treatment   of  the   Parkinson disease  at   present  and  drugs un der  development  are   outlined .

To   begin   with ,   the   following   present  drugs  are   explained :  Levodopa ,   dopamine   agonist ,  monoamine  oxidase   B   inhibitor ,  anticholinergic   agent  and   NMDA   receptor  antagonist .

Next ,   KW - 6002 ,   ONO - 2506 ,   and   TCH - 346 ,   which  are  un der  development   at   present  are   explained .

Finally ,   future  direction   of  the  development  are   also  described .

Roles  of   a   doctor   are   to   explain  earlier  systematically   on   patient's   state   and   change   of  mind   for   the   family .

Roles  of  a  nurse  are   to  evaluate  earlier   what   is   required  in  the   family   and   to correspond   with  it .

Roles  of   a   social   worker  are   to   assess  psychological   and   social   problems  between  a   patient  and   his   family ,   to grasp  the   problems  held  in   family   and   to   support  with   the team  medicine .

It   is   explained   by   presenting   the  case   of   a   50 ‐ year ‐old man .

Care   to  the   family   after   bereavement   is  mentioned

Using   Gabor  transform ,   the   authors  developed a   method   for   removing   only grid   component   from   the  image  photographed   u sing   anti - scattered grid .

Gabor  transform   is   a  kind   of   window  Fourier  transformation  that   carries  out   Fourier  transformation   within   Gauss  window .

This   method  uses  Gabor  transform tuned in   accordance  to  the   period   of  the grid   as  the  filter  function   for grid   extraction .

In  an   example   of  thorax   image ,  this   paper   shows  that   compared   with   the grid   removal   treatment   u sing   a  low - pass  filter ,   the  treatment   u sing   Gabor  transform   shows  little blur and   little  degradation   of   high   frequency  component .

In  the   past  study ,   sadium  rabeprazole   20   mg   was  used  to   maximize  the   result .

This  time,   we used   10   mg   instead   since  this   dose   is  used  to   treat   reflux   esophagitis   in   most   clinics .

We selected   132   patients  with   heartburn due   to   reflux   esophagitis .

The   result   showed  that   regardless   of   patient's  sex ,   age ,   and   severity ,   sadium  rabeprazole  improved   the symptom  after   6   hours,   and  its  effect   lasted   for   7   days .

Thus ,   sadium  rabeprazole   10   mg   seemed to   be   very  effective   against   reflux   esophagitis .

Fulminant-type myocarditis   is  an  intractable  disease   of   which about   half  the  number   die  even   with   the intensive   care ,   and  establishment   of  the  therapy  which   positively  sedates  the inflammation   is   desired .

The   authors carried  out  the  clinical   and   basic  examinations  about  the  effects  of  immunoglobulin  or  its   Fc   part ( Ig ) - fused   protein   on  the  fulminant  myocarditis .

The effects  and   features  of   IVIg   were   analyzed   from   the  clinical   experience   of  the   IVIg   treatment   of   human  fulminant-type myocarditis ,   and   the statistical   significance   of  the  mortality due   to   IVIg  could   not   be   recognized ,  but  the  mortality   of  the   administered   cases tended to   be  low .

As  a  basic  examination ,   the myocarditis   suppression  effect   of  the   Ig - fused   protein   between   various  cytokines  and  immunity - related   genes  was  examined   u sing   the  rat   autoimmune  myocarditis   model .

As  a   result ,  it   was   shown  that   the   IL - 13 - Ig ,   CTLA 4 - Ig ,   IL - 1   receptor  antagonist - Ig ,   SLPI - Ig   and   IL - 22 - Ig   treatments   were  effective .

By  clarifying   the  relationship  between  the  occurrence   of  the  hepatotoxicity   in   Japanese  tuberculosis   patients treated  with  antitubercular  drugs  containing   isoniazid   ( INH)   and   NAT 2   gene   polymorphism ,   and   between  the  occurrence   and   the   aging ,   we examined  the  possibility   of  setting   a   medication  standard   based  on   INH  gene   polymorphism  in   consideration   with   the   aging .

We   medicated   INH  to  seven  elderly tuberculosis   patients  ( average   age   of   82 . 1   years  old ) ,   and   22   young   tuberculosis   patients  ( average   of   40 . 1   years  old ) ,   and   then   measured   the  concentration   of   INH  and   metabolite   ( N - acetyl  isoniazid )   in blood   and  urine .

We   judged   NAT 2   gene - polymorphism analysis   u sing   the  Invader   method .

With   Rapid   acetylator ,   no  manifestation   of  hepatopathy  was  observed  neither   in  the elderly  patient group  nor   in  the  young   patient group .

With   Intermediate  acetylator ,  hepatopathy  occurred  in   one   per   3   patients in  elderly  and   one   per   7   patients in   youth .

The  AUC   values  of   INH  in  hepatopathy  patients group   were   higher   in   young   patients than in  elderly  patients .

By   u sing   pharmacogenetics  ( PGx ) ,   the drug  therapy   for   elderly  patients   is   expected to   be  practical   and  efficient .

In   medical   treatment   for   the elderly   over   the   age   of   70 ,   we analyzed  how   much   medical   expenses and  drug  costs involved  in  which   disease  item .

By  classifying   the  medical   treatment   over   the   age   of   70   u sing   the   Patient   Survey   and   the   Survey   of   National   Medical   Care   Insurance   Services  conducted   by   the Ministry   of   Health ,   Labour and   Welfare   ( MHLW )   in  2002 ,   the  medical   expenses and  drug  costs  are   estimated  per  each   disability  in  intermediate  classification   ( 199   classifications ) .

The   most   expensive  disability   among   disabilities including   general   medical   treatments   is  hypertension disability .

However ,   among  those   for   the elderly ,   the  medical   expense   for  hypertension disability   ( 753 , 100   million  yen )   is  lower  than  that   for  cerebral   infarction   ( 970  billion  yen ) ,   followed   by  renal  failure  and   fracture .

In  terms   of  the drug   injection  and   medical   expenses   for   those   disabilities   for   the elderly  treatment ,   the hypertension disability ,   among   119  disabilities ,   accounts   for   the  highest   percentage  in  drug   injection  and  its  medical   expense   is   also  high   ( approximately   30 % ) .

Advance   on  the nutritional   administration   from   parenteral  nutrition   ( PN )   to  total   parenteral  nutrition   ( TPN )   is  introduced .

Enteral  nutrition   ( EN )   is   reexamined due   to  complications   of   TPN .

Indication  and   administrating   path   of   parenteral   and  enteral  nutrition  are   described .

Energy  requirement   of   Japanese   is   25 〜 35 kcal / kg .

Practice   and   cautionary   note   of   EN   and   PN  are   outlined .

Finally ,   complications   and   the  countermeasures  are   mentioned .

We analyzed   231   cases  of  transmis sion   of   infectious  disease   by blood   transfusion ,   reported to   Japanese   Red   Cross   Central  Blood   Center   between   January  2004   and   December  2004 ,   and   completed   follow  up  study .

Transmis sion   of  hepatitis   B  virus ,  hepatitis   C   virus ,   and   HIV   had   been   significantly  decreased   because   of  implementation   of   mini - pool   PCR   test ing .

However ,   there   is  still large  number   of   reports  for   infectious  disease  transmis sion   from  all   over   the  country ,   suggesting   further   investigation  to   identify  the  cause   of   such  transmis sion .

From   June  2003 ,   we  started   follow  up  study   on   positive  conversion   cases .

Research   and   development   of  a   new cancer  imaging   diagnostic  technique   which   can   accurately  and  efficiently diagnose   the  trunk  part   cancer   was  made   u sing   multimodal  image   of  the  trunk  part .

A  large - scale  image  database   was  constructed   by   the  powerful  cooperative   relation   between   medical   people   and   engineers  to  establish  a  computer   aided imaging   diagnostic  technique   by  utilizing   the  large - scale   database .

A  trunk  part   cancer   detection  and   diagnosis   algorithm   based  on  the quantitative  basis   of  the analytical   results  by  large - scale  image  data  was   developed  by  quantitatively analyzing   the  morphological   and   functional  image  characteristics   of  the  trunk  part   cancer   lesion   from   the  trunk  part   three - dimensional   multimodal  image .

Practical   application   of  the   new cancer   diagnostic  image  apparatus   of  the  trunk  part   cancer   is   expected   by   performance   enhancement  with   repeated  clinical   evaluation   of  the  developmental   algorithm .

In   remote  mountainous   areas ,   10 . 4 %   of   surgical   outpatients  complained  of  the   pain   of  knees ,   17 %   of   whom  suffered   from   gonarthrosis   . The  causes  of   gonarthrosis   are   weight gain or  an  occupational   history   of  the  lift   of   heavy  goods .

If it   progresses ,   genu  varum  (  bowleg   )  occurs.

For   the   way  to  implement   examinations ,  diagnosis   and   treatment ,  symptoms ,  physical  findings ,   joint synovia  examination ,   and   X - ray   photography  are   explained .

For   treatment  and   education   for   patients  with   gonarthrosis ,  weight  loss ,  use   of   a  stick ,  quadriceps mus cle   of thigh  training ,   extrapolation board ,   supporters ,  antiphlogistic  analgetics ,  oral   administration   of  glucosamine   and   chondroitin ,   knee   joint  centesis   and   injection  are   explained .

For   a   surgical   remedy ,   high   shank abduction  osteotomy ,   and   artificial   knee   joint   replacement  are   explained .

The timing   for   the   patient  to   be  introduced  to   a   specialist   and   the   way  to  consult   the  specialist   and   advice   from  him/her  are   described .

Purpose   of  clinical   pathway ,  utilization  to   informed  consent  and   preparation   of   a   pamphlet  are   described .

Operative   method ,   reconstructive   surgery ,   preoperative   care   and   postoperative   care   of  pneumoscopic   excision   for   esophageal   cancer   are   outlined .

Case   who  does  not   become  the indication   for   clinical   pathway   is   explained .

Outline   of  the  clinical   pathway   in   surgery   for   esophageal   cancer   and  correspondence  to  the  variance  are   explained .

Descriptions   and   problems  to  the   patients  and   family   in  the  variance   generation  are   described .

In  these  years ,   the   need  of   measures   for   chronic   kidney  disease ( CKD )   has   been greatly  felt ,   with   the   result   of   intensively  recognizing  importance   of  the  glomerular  filtration   rate ( GFR ) - estimated   formula .

It   is   proposed   that   all  the  case   with   GFR   below   60 ml /  min . / 1 . 73 m2   is   defined  as   CKD ,   classified   according   to  the   respective   GFR   with   the corresponding   therapeutic   guide .

The   GFR - estimated   formula  common  to  the   world   is   expected   for   the  sake  of   worldwidely  recognizing   the   need to   deal   with   CKD   and   sharing   effective   measures   for   CKD .

The  international   movement  concerning   the   GFR - estimated   formula   is   outlined .

For  slight  recognition dysfunction   ( MCI )   examples  and   the  Alzheimer  disease   ( AD )   patients ,  the nutrition  intervention   was  continued ,   and  observance   and   the  effect   of  the nutrition   guidance   were   analyzed .

The nutritional   state   of  the   recognition disease   patients  was  classified   by gross  energy  intake  in   order   to  intervene   the nutrition   more   careful ,   and   75 g   glucose   tolerance   test   was  carried  out   on  the gross  energy   excess group   and   the glycolipid dysbolism  was  classified .

Modification   of  the  feeding   behavior   and   sugar   superfluous  intake  are   doing   first   of  all  in   proportion  to   features  of  the nutritional   state   by   the nutritional  intervention .

The   patients   were   guided to take  fish   1  time at   least , the green   and   yellow   vegetables   2   times and   fruits   full   of  vitamin   C   1time every   day .

Prepulse   inhibition  and   prepulse - startle interval   ( PPI - PSI )   were   used  to   measure  how   patients  with   schizophrenia   differ   from   healthy individuals  in   processing   sensory   information .

The   sound   intensity  and   VAS  score   showed a  positive  correlation  in  the  control ,   which  indicated  the  validity   of  converting   sound   intensity into   VAS  score .

The  inhibitory  effect   of  stimulus  intensity   registered   by   presentation   of   prepulse   was   significantly   weakened in  the   patients group .

The  observed  abnormalities in   PPI - PSI   among  the   schizophrenic   patients  are   considered  to  indicate  a  disorder   in   functional   control   of sensory   input .

Addition   of  fentanyl  patch  and   long - acting  oxycodone   pill  to  morphine   as  opioids   for   treatment   of   pain  in   medium  to   advanced  cancer   patients  has  expanded  the width   of   available   treatment .

Oxycodone   was   created  as   a  semi -synthetic   derivative .

It   exhibits  relatively  high   affinity  to   mu   receptor ,   and   is   considered  to   demonstrate its analgesic   action   through   mu   receptor .

Its  do sage  can   be  increased  as   much   as  necesssary .

It   is  effective   for   controlling   pain  in   patients  who  suffer   from  neuropathic   pain .

The  side -effects  of  oxycodone   are   similar   in  quality  and   severity  to  those   of  morphine .

63   cases to  which  the standby coronary  artery   plasty   was   applied   were   divided into  the  fenofibrate  administered group   and   the  control group ,  and   the   CETP   ( cholesterol  ester  transfer   protein )   activity  before   administration   and   6   months  after   administration   and   the  lipoprotein   fraction   by   the   HPLC   method   were   measured .

The  fenofibrate  administered group   had   significant  TG   decrease  and   HDL - C  increase ,   significant  increase   of  the   LDL   particle   size  with   decrease   of  the   small   LDL   fraction ,   and   significant  decrease   of  the   HDL   particle   size  with  increase   of  the   small   HDL   fraction .

It   also  had   decrease   of  the   CETP   activity  and  a   negative  correlation   between  the  decrease   of  the   CETP   activity  and   the   change   of  the   LDL   particle   size .

A  possibility   was  indicated  that  fenofibrate may   cause   change   of  the  lipoprotein   fraction   through   the   CETP   activity  control .

We   examined   48   low  birth  weight infants  with   periventricular   leukomalacia  ( PVL ) .

The study   subjects  consisted  of   43   normal   infants  and   5   infants  with   PVL .

Compared  to  the normal group ,   PVL group   had   significantly  reduced  cerebral blood   volume in  the  right  internal   carotid   artery   measured  at   0 ,   2 ,   63 ,   and   91   days  old .

Moreover ,   PVL group   had   significantly  reduced  cerebral blood   volume in  the   left  internal   carotid   artery   measured  at   0 ,   2 ,   4 ,   21 ,   28 ,   56 ,   63 ,   84 ,   and   91   days  old .

The   result   suggested  that   the   reduced blood   flow  in  the  brain  after  the  birth   is   possibly  due   to  the  damage  in  the  white  matter .

Data   on  the cord blood   bank   in  our  hospital   was analysed .

A  questionnaire   survey targeting   women   who gave   birth at  the   hospital   was  conducted .

Approximately   40 %   of   women   who gave   birth at  the   hospital   registered  in  the  bank ,  while   only   60 %   of  those   were  eligible   for   collection   of blood .

Only   13   of   77   mothers  participated in  the   survey   said  they   were   willing   to   donate cord blood   to  the  bank .

Premature  labor ,   multiple  pregnancy ,  or   premature  rupture   of   membrane   prohibited  some  from   donating  blood .

Fixing   the   methods  used  at  the   hospital   for   disseminating   information   on  the blood   bank   increased   the speed  of  collecting   cord blood .

The   administration   of  branched - chain  amino  acid  ( BCAA )  granule   pharmaceutical   was  carried  out  to   patients  with   liver   cirrhosis   for   12   months ,   and   the  transition   of   amino  acid  metabolism   route  mainly   on  the  glutamic   acid  was  examined .

The   BUN   value   and   Fisher   ratio   rose   significantly  after   administration   of  the   BCAA  granule   pharmaceutical   for   1   year ,   and   the   PT   activity  value   showed  the  upward  tendency .

The  glutamic   acid  value ,   BCAA   value ,   alanine   value ,   aspartic   acid  value   rose   significantly ,   and   the  asparagine   value   and   glutamine   value   showed  the  upward  tendency ,   and   the  cystine   value   showed  the  downward  tendency .

Amino  acid  which  seemed to   be  a  main  factor   of  the nitrogen  load   was   AAA   ( phenylalanine   + tyrosine ) ,  asparagine ,   aspartic   acid  and   cystine .

The  dietary  counselling  mainly   on  the   protein   restriction   for   12 g   of   amino  acid  in granule   pharmaceutical   connotation   was thought  to   be  necessary   in   BCAA  granule   pharmaceutical   administration .

The steamed egg   custard   in  which   3 g   of galactosylsucrose   ( lactosucrose )   was  containing   for   1   was   developed and   1   per  day   was   given   to  the   sound  female  college students   for   2   weeks ,   and   the  effect   on  the  defecation   was  examined .

The increase   in   defecation   days ,  stool   frequency ,   defecation  quantity   was   recognized  in  the  test   food   intake   stage .

The  significant   change   was   not   recognized  in   property ,   color   tone ,   smell ,   hardness   of  the  convenience ,  sense   after  the  defecation ,   generation   of  the abdomen symptom ,  feces   pH ,   amount   of   ammonia ,   and   amount   of  moisture .

The  significant  increase   in   Lactobacillus  bifidus  occupancy   rate in  the  bacterial   flora   in  feces  was   recognized  in  the  test   food   intake   stage .

The effects   on  the  hematologic   test ,  hemato- biochemical   test ,  urinalysis ,  abdomen symptom   were   examined in  the   safety  test   in  which   3   pieces  of  test   food   per  day   were   given   for   4   weeks ,   and   the   fluctuation  to   cause   a  clinical   problem  was   not   recognized .

It   was  indicated  that   the  test   food   was  effective   for  improvement   on  the  defecation  and   was   safe .

A   case   with   the above - mentioned disease   in   a   72 - year -old man   was   reported .

The disease   was  diagnosed   with  gas gangrene   from   the  clinical   view,  X - ray  examination ,   and   MRI .

Debridement   was enforced .

Peptostreptococcus  sp . ,   Prevotella   sp . ,   Bacteroides sp . ,  and   Corynebacterium  sp .   were   detected .

Dermatoplasty   was enforced   after  the  operation .

The  case   was  in   a   29 - year -old   woman ,   who  was   hospitalized   with   the   suspicion   of   acute  meningitis  during   the   progress   of   primary   Sjoegren  syndrome  ( SS ) .

It   was  judged  as  asceptic  meningitis   accompanied   by   SS   from  immunoserologic  examination  and  examination   of  cerebrospinal   fluid ,   and  it   was   rapidly improved   by   dexamethasone   administration .

However ,  it   recurred twice   afterwards .

In   addition , serum anti - SS - B  antibody   value ,  serum  IGg  value ,   and  cerebrospinal   fluid  anti - SS - A antibody   value   showed rises  one   and   all ,   in   comparison  with   those   before  the  crisis   of  meningitis .

In this   case ,  aseptic  meningitis   recurred  in  an   identical   patient ,   and   the  case   seems  to   be  a  precious   case   which  indicates  the  relation   between  aseptic  meningitis   and   activity   of   SS .

The  mechanism  of   appetite   suppression   by  selective  serotonin   reuptake  inhibitors  was analysed .

Single   administration   of   fluvoxamine   ( FL 9 )   to  mice   after  diurnal   fasting   failed to   achieve   appetite   suppression .

Administration   of   FL   after   administration   of  the selective  serotonin   5 - HT2 C   receptor - selective  antagonist   SB 242084   ( SB )   did   exhibit   appetite   suppression .

It   suggested  the  involvement   of   MC 4   and   MC 3   receptors .

Also  the   procedure  simultaneously  activated   POMC   neurons   in  hypothalamus .

The increased  expression   of   SGK - 1   gene   was  observed  in  mice   administered   with   both   SB  and   FL .

Effectiveness   of   Borei - matsu - kami  in  the   Chinese   medicine   extract   is  examined .

An   acute   aggravation   case   ( 69 - year -old   woman )   of   later  menopausal syndromes ,  an  impulse buy   case   ( 67 - year -old   woman )   with   circulatory  psychosis ,   and   a   case   ( 50 - year -old   woman )   of   functional  gastroenteritis   whose  symptoms   were  improved   by   Borei - matsu - kami  are   presented .

In   present   examination ,  it   has   been   proven   that   the good  effectiveness   is   expected ,   when   Borei - matsu - kami   is   added to  the disease   with   mild  and   moderate psychoneurosis  symptoms  in  the  case   of  the insufficient  sedative  and   anxiolytic   actions   of  main  prescription .

And ,   Borei - matsu - kami  also improved  symptoms   such   as  apathy  and   depression  status .

Relation   between   headache  and   sin usitis   is   discus sed .

Experienced   cases  of   sin usitis  exhibiting   the symptoms  consistent  with  diagnostic   criteria   of   primary   headache  are   shown .

A   case   ( 17 - year -old   woman )   of  the  hemicrania type ,   a   case   ( 55 - year -old man )   of  the  catatonic   headache type ,   and   a   case   ( 26 - year -old man )   of  the  cluster   headache type  are   presented .

In   addition ,   the  relation   between   sin usitis   and   headache ,   and  examination  findings   of   headache  by   sin usitis   are   shown .

A   case   ( 74 - year -old   woman )   of  hepatocellular  carcinoma   needed to   distinguish   from   focal   nodular hyperplasia   is   reported .

Central   cicatrices  and blood   vessel  structure   of  the  clear   axle   state   were   observed  in  the diagnostic  imaging ,   and  hepatocellular  carcinoma  or   focal   nodular hyperplasia   ( FNH )   was   suspected .

In  the en dermic   needle  biopsy ,   FNH   was   negative ,   and  hepatocellular  carcinoma   was  diagnosed ,   and   there fore  the  liver   posterior  segment  area   excision   was  conducted .

Histopathological  diagnosis   showed  hepatocellular  carcinoma  mainly  with   moderately- differentiated carcinoma .

The  male   patient un derwent  the initial  diagnosis  at  the   age   of   10 .

After  the  removal   of  the tumor   in  the   fourth  ventricle ,   excision   of  the tumor   adhered  to  the  medulla  oblongata  was  impossible .

The   progress   following   the  multimodal   therapy including   transplantation   of  the  self - peripheral blood  stem cells   was   favorable ,  but  after  that ,  disseminated   recurrence   was  brought about .

Since   chemotherapy did   not  improve  the disease   state ,   expanded  autologous  lymphocytes transfusion   ( ALT )   was   performed   for   the  case   of  the   resistance   cerebellum blastoma  and  elimination   of  the tumor   was   recognized .

However   since   recurrence   of  the tumor   was  observed   1   year   and   sevenths month   later ,   periodically intravenous  infusion   of  vinblastine ,   3 - substance   ( methotrexate ,   cytarabine   and  hydrocortisone )   instraspinal   injection ,   and   ALT   added  with  orientating   radiation   exposure   were   performed ,   and   as  the   result ,   the tumor   disappeared  and   no  side  effects   associated  with   recurrence   was   not   recognized .

Although   ALT   caused  medulloblastoma   recurrence ,   combined  use   with  other  therapy   proved  to   be  anttitumor  effect  and  effective   for   QOL  improvement .

The  significance   of   healthy  life expectancy   as   a   health  index ,   how  it   should   be   calculated ,   and   the   characteristics   of  the  current  indices  are   described .

Healthy  life expectancy   is   divided into   DALE  or   DFLE .

DALE  requires   work   on   assigning   weight  to  each   health  or   disorder   index  beforehand .

DFLE  requires  a   definition   of   health .

DFLE  cannot   be  used  as   a   single  indicator   of   health .

A   case   with   the above - mentioned disease   in   a   26 - year -old man   was   reported .

The   chief  complaint   of  the   patient   was  the  skin  eruption   over   the   whole  body .

The disease   was  diagnosed   with  Darier's  disease   by   the  clinical   and   the   pathohistological   views .

Candida   albicans   was   detected   from   the   affected  area .

The symptom  was   not  improved   by   administration   of antibiotics  and   etretinate .

Exacerbation   of  the symptom  was   suppressed   by   the  decrease   in  the   amount   of   etretinate  and   the internal  use   of  itraconazole .

The topic   was   extracted   from   the   report   on   visual   acuity ,   refraction   and   adjustment ,   and   was  introduced .

The   report which  examined   characteristics   of  the sweep  VEP   on  the  visual   acuity  in   detail   was  introduced .

And ,   the   research   which  examined  effect   of  the eye  optics  system   on  the  contrast sensitivity   was  introduced .

The   reports   on   refraction  corrective   operation  and   wave   aberration ,   IOL   and   wave   aberration ,   accommodative   IOL ,   frequency   and  epidemiology  of   ametropia ,   treatment   for   the  complication   of   pathologic  myopia   were   introduced  on  the   refraction .

In   addition ,   the   reports   on   research   of myopia  occurrence   mechanism  in  the  experimental myopia ,   heredity   of   pathologic  myopia   and   genetic  analysis ,   treatment   of  the myopia   were   also introduced .

The   reports   on  the   adjustment   by   the  length   chromatic  aberration ,  objective   measurement   of  the   adjustment ,   adjustment  and   the   aging   were   introduced  on  the   adjustment .

The  liver  abscess   is   a   generic   name  of  the  condition  in  which  the   pathogen   advances  in  the  liver tissue   from   outside  of  the  liver ,   and   the  pus   accumulates in  the  liver   with  tissue   destruction  and   necrosis .

Fundamental   treatment  policy   is   administration   of  optimum  antimicrobial   agent  and  centesis   and   attraction   of  the abscess .

There   are   cases in  which  the   general   peritonitis   is   caused   by  abscess  rupture  and   cases in  which   surgical   cutting   and   laparotomy  cleaning   drainage  are   required  on  drainage  failure   examples ,  etc .

Disease   state   ( bacterial  abscess ,   amaebic   liver  abscess ) ,  symptom  and   diagnostic  image ,   treatment   ( administration   of antimicrobial   agent ,  abscess centesis ,  drainage ,   surgical   treatment )   of  the  liver  abscess   were   outlined .

Twenty  cases in  which  cervical   island   flap  was  used   for  immediate  reconstruction   after tumor   resection   of  oral   cancers   were   reported ,   and   complications   of  the   reconstruction   were   investigated .

Eighty  cases  of   squamous  cell  carcinoma ,   one   case   of   adenosquamous  carcinoma ,   and   one   case   of   adenoid   cystic   carcinoma   were   included .

Twelve   cases   were   carcinomas   of  tongue ,   five   cases   were   carcinomas   of   floor   of  the   mouth ,   and   three   cases   were   carcinomas   of  the lower  gingiva .

There   were   five   case   of  postoperative   flap  necrosis ,  which  did   not   require   additional   surgical   repair.

It   is   considered   that  cervical   island   skin   is  useful   for   reconstruction   of   moderate tissue   loss  in  elderly  patients or   in   patients  who  are   complicating   systematic   disease ,   because  the   surgical   method   is   simple  and   postoperative   functions   can   be  maintained .

The  mahaim lattice   is   a   special   sub - conduction   path  which   is   coupling   heart  atrium  or   heart  ventricle  to  conduction  system ,   and  it   has  the  decrement  conduction   characteristics  similar  to  the   atrioventricular   node .

A   case   ( 43 - year -old man )   which  combined   3   kinds  of   frequent  pulse  :   2   kinds  of   reverse   direction   atrium   entry   frequent  pulse   ( AVRT )   by   the  mahaim lattice   and   the   usual   atrioventricular   node   recursion   frequent  pulse   was   reported .

This   case   is   the  mahaim lattice   which   is   coupled to   heart  atrium   and   right   crus  branch ,   and   the   heart  atrium  edge exists in  the   tricus pid   valve  theory   free  wall .

Though   the  delta  wave   was   not   recognized and  it   was  a  normal  electocardiogram ,  the   QRS   became wide   with   the   extension   of   P - QRS ,   which   was   dependent   on  the   heart  atrium  stimulation   frequency   and   the   left bun dle  branch block type  delta  wave   became apparent .

The slight dull M  potential   was   recorded  on  the  back  wall  in  the   tricus pid   valve  theory   division ,   and  it   succeeded in  the  detachment   of  the  mahaim lattice   by  energization  in  the   region .

The technique   for   carrying   out  the   pacing   in  multiple  position  in  the   tricus pid   valve  theory   division ,  examining   the  place   w here   the rise   of   QRS   from   the stimulation   becomes shortest ,   mapping   the vicinity  in   detail   and  finding   the M   potential  enables to   shorten  the technique   hour  of  the   whole   process   from   the diagnosis   of  the  mahaim lattice  to  the ablation .

In   schizophrenic   of   2   cases  (   33 ‐ year ‐old   women  and   32 ‐ year ‐old  men   )   showing   much  drinking   and   polyuria  around  the  month ,  water   intoxication  took   place   during   the  treatment .

The  previous   case   showed  rhabdomyolysis   from  water   intoxication .

It   is   considered   that   both   cases belonged to   a   category   of  psychogenic   water  drinking .

It   was   shown  that  electrolyte abnormality  and  effects  of antipsychotic  drug ,   etc .   were   regarded as  an  inductive   cause   of  rhabdomyolysis   from  water   intoxication .

With   45   cases  of   kidney transplantation   as  objects ,  the  relations   of   appeared time of an abnormal  image   of   idiopathic   necrosis   of  the  femoral   head   ( I)   in   MRI ,   a   pattern   of  image  at  initial   stage ,   and   depressed   deformality   by   x ‐ ray ,   were   examined .

Abnormal  image   is   4 . 5   months  after  transplantation   on  the   average  in   12   cases .

Band  images appeared  as  an  initial   change ,   and  it   was   possible  to   determine   the  area   surrounded  by  a   band   as  a  necrotic   range .

MR   disease  classification  and   X ‐ ray   prognosis  agreed   well .

I   forecast   by   MRI   appears  possible .

This  study  aimed at  the elucidation   of  the  cau sing   gene   of   hereditary   neurologic   disease   u sing   the technique   of  positional   cloning ,   and   the   molecular   mechanism  of  the  degeneration   of   nerve   cell .

Outbreak   of   a series  of  diseases those   are   the  inheritance  spinocerebellar  degradation  and   adrenal   leucodystrophy  that   is   demyelinate disease   of  sex ‐ linked   resessive   inheritance  are  elucidated .

As  a   result ,   gene   locus   of  two neurologic   diseases  of  spinocerebellar  degeneration   with   Machado‐ Joseph  disease  and   hypoalbuminemia   was  discovered ,   and   a   cause   gene   of   a   dentatum  nucleus   red  nucleus   pallidum  Luys  body   atrophy  was  discovered .

And ,  a   result   supporting   strongly  that   " putative   ALD   gene "   which   Mandel  et  al .   got   isolated  is   a   cause   gene   of  the   adrenal   leucodystrophy  was  obtained .

Main  countries  occupy  over   70 %   of  test   numbers  in   Thailand ,   Indonesia   and   India .

Physico‐ chemical   properties  of  the drug   in  the title   is   outlined .

This  drug   was   a synthetic  drug   of   carbapenem antibiotics  panipenem  and  organic  anion  transport  inhibitor   betamipron   for   reduction   of  nephrotoxicity .

Each   pharmaceutical   and  physico‐ chemical   properties  is  enumerated ,   and   do sage   form   design   and  stability   of   pharmaceutical   in  the title  are   outlined .

This  drug   is  stable  even  in  storage  at   room temperature ,   and   both interactions   are   also  inhibited  because  it   is   double  layer   freeze drying   pharmaceutical .

It   is   reported a   case   of   50 ‐ year ‐old  female  with   chief  complaint   of   par  oxysmal ardor   which   was  diagnosed  venticular   extrasystole   by   Holter  electrocardiography.

Extrasystole  and  train   of  pulses   were  improved   by  oral   administration   of   mexiletine   ( I )   300 mg ,  but   II above   mentioned  drug   was   administered   since   foci  changed   chaotic .

Subjective symptoms   were  improved  excellently  by   II  administration ,   and   I  could   be  discontinued   since   extrasystol   frequency   was   decreased  and   continuous  stimulus   generation   was  disappeared .

It   is   considered   that   II improved  arrhythmia  indirectly  by   providing   of  psychosomatic   harmony .

As  a   result   of  the  examination  in  the   NUD   patients ,   delaying   in  stomach   discharge  function  and   involvement   of  mental   factor   were   considered  in  the disease   state ,   and   the  involvement   of   Hp  infection   was   also  considered  in  some  cases .

Helicobacter  pylori ( Hp )   infection   was   affected   promotively   for  stomach   discharge  function .

Combination   of   depressive   state   and  tendency   of   neurosis  acompanied   by   prolongation   of   troubling   were   observed  in  the  examination   of  mental  functions .

Enterokinesis  stimulants   were  effective   in  the  cases  of  stomach   discharge  delay   and   Hp  non‐ infections .

Anesthesized  rats   were   laparotomized and   pancreatic  juice   was  collected through   the   pancreatic  duct   catheter   and   catheterized  in  the stomac   for   administration   of enprostil   ( I) ,   then   after   4   days   experiments  without  anesthetization   were   performed .

Pancreatic  juice   was  collected  every   30   minutes intervals   after   starting   the  experiments .

After   measuring   a   volume  of   pancreatic  juice ,   except   for   protein  and   bicarbonate  ion   measurements ,   remaining   pancreatic  juice   was   mixed   with   the  bile ,   and   was   returned to  the duodenum  in  the   after   30   minutes  of   experiment .

After  collecting   basal  secretion  in   90  minutes  I ,   1 . 0 μg / kg   was   administered  intragastrically ,   and   the  effect   for  exocrine   pancreas  in   2   hours  was  examined .

Effect   for  exocrine   pancreas  in   1   hour was  examined   after   administered   I ,   1 . 0 μg  intravenously .

Pemilorast   potassium ,   20 mg / day   was   administered   for   6 〜 62   weeks  (   mean   26 . 1   weeks )   for   adult   bronchial  asthma  patients  of   40   cases .

General  improvements  noted   were  above  improved   47 . 4 %   and   fairly improved   73 . 7 %   after   8   weeks and   those   of   64 . 0 %   and   92 . 0 % ,   respectively ,   after   24   weeks .

Significant  improvements  with  scored   evaluations   in  each  item   were   observed   after   2   weeks .

No   side  effects   were   noted .

This   disease   is   myeloproliferative  disorder   as   characteristics   of granulocyting   increase  and  splenoma  with   the   juvenile  neutrophil   appearance ,   and  it  occupies about   15 〜 20 %   of  all   leukemias .

Diagnoses are   decided  by  obvious  lowering   of blood   neutrophil  alkaline   phosphatase   activity  and   proof   of   Philadelphia   chromosomes  by   bone  marrow  cellular   chromosome analysis .

It   is   divided into   chronic   phase   which  continues   for   several   years  and   acute   phase   which   accepts  gemmule   increase   called  acute  transformation ,   and   there   are   alpha interferon   and   homogeneous   bone  marrow  transplantation   as  therapies  of   chronic   phase .

Early   detection   is  important .

Cyclosporin   3 mg / kg / day   was   administered  as  initial   amount   for   9   cases  of   patients in  the title ,   when  efflorescence  improvements   were   recognized   afterwards ,  the drug   was   decreased  to   0 . 5 〜 1 . 0 mg / kg / day   for   4   weeks .

It   was   6   cases to   show   clinical  effects  more   than effective   effect   by   administration   of this  drug .

When   peripheral blood   CD   positive   cells   ( I)   numbers   were  obtained   from  mononucleosis   and   I  ratio ,  some increases   were   recognized ,   and  mainly  reflecting   B  cell  increases  of  positive   CD 19   were   supposed .

Immunological   mechanisms   of  psoriasis   crisis   are   outlined ,   and   the  significance   of   I increase   is  examined .

Japanese  asthma  treatment   guidelines  published  last   year   showed a   new treatment  system  that   considers  inhalation  steroid   as  the  main  chlonic  asthma  treatment  drug .

Antiallergic   agents  that   reduce   allergy  inflammation  are  effective   for   cases  with   mild  to   moderate atopic  asthma  with   less  side  effect .

They  are   especially effective   for   patients  with   complications   and   children .
